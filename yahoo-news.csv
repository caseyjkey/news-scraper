Bitcoin Tech Analysis – Recap and Mid-Day Review – 04/07/19," Bitcoin rallied by 10.09% on Wednesday. Following on from a 2.29% gain on Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,983. A bullish start to the day set the tone, with Bitcoin on the move from the start of the day. Bitcoin rallied from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. The moves through the early hours saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and the first major resistance level at $11,762.87. A pullback to sub-$11,000 levels by late morning saw Bitcoin steer clear of the first major support level at $10,087.13 before a late rally. The late rally saw Bitcoin break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275, first major resistance level at $11,323.93, and second major resistance level at $11,762.87 to hit an intraday high $12,025. Resistance at $12,000 limited the upside on the day. The Bitcoin rally led to Bitcoin’s dominance rising back to 62% levels. Bitcoin’s market cap jumped to a Wednesday high $213.5bn before easing back. Bitcoin ultimately provided support to the broader crypto market, leading the majors into positive territory on the day. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December’s swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin continued to find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Wednesday’s rally was another day of correlation with the more mature markets. The rally kicked in well ahead of economic data out of the U.S, however. Weak U.S stats continued to support the FED’s projected rate cut later in the day year. While the cheaper cost of funds is a boon for riskier assets, the current interest rate environment continues to be supportive. A negative for Bitcoin and the broader market continues to be the prospect of a material shift in the regulatory landscape. There’s also the pending SEC decisions on the Bitcoin ETFs to consider. The recent volatility across the broader market has come at the wrong time for those hoping for Bitcoin ETFs to be approved. The good news, however, is the fact that there have been no headline cases of exchanges being hacked… Another piece of good news is the fact that the planned launch of Facebook’s Libra has done no damage just yet… At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.63% to $11,787. In the early part of the day, Bitcoin rose to a start of a day high $12,065 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,379.33, Bitcoin fell back to a late morning low $11,503. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33, Bitcoin moved back through to $11,700 levels. For the Bitcoin bulls, $12,000 looks to be the line in the sand. A hold onto $11,700 levels through the early afternoon would support a move back through to $11,900 levels. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $12,065. In the event of a breakout, the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 would come into play before any pullback. Failure to hold onto $11,700 levels could see Bitcoin slide back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Barring an extended sell-off through the afternoon, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit the downside. In the event of a sell-off, expect a return to sub-$11,000 levels before finding support.

"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 03/07/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC fell by 2.59% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 4.11% gain from Monday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $408.02. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall from an early intraday high $418.87 to a late morning intraday low $383.16. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the 23.6% FIB of $418 and the first major support level at $394.38. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin Cash ABC recovered to $400 levels to limit the loss on the day. In spite of the partial recovery, Bitcoin Cash ABC was unable to move back through the 23.6% FIB… At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 1.1% to $412.50. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $408.41 to a high $418.0. Whilst falling short of the first major resistance level at $423.54, the 23.6% FIB of $418 continued to limit progress. For the day ahead, Bitcoin Cash ABC would need to steer clear of sub-$410 levels to support another run at the first major resistance level at $423.54. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the 23.6% FIB of $418. An extended crypto rally through the day could see Bitcoin Cash ABC test the second major resistance level at $439.06. Failure to avoid sub-$410 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC slide back through to sub-$400 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, the first major support level at $387.87 should limit any downside on the day. Litecoin slid by 3.26% on Tuesday. Reversing a 0.42% gain from Monday with interest, Litecoin ended the day at $118.59. A particularly bearish morning saw Litecoin slide from an intraday high $123.41 to a mid-morning intraday low $111.2. The reversal saw Litecoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $117 and the first major support level at $114.94. Finding support through the afternoon, Litecoin managed a brief return to $120 levels before easing back. The 23.6% FIB proved to be the resistance line on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 1.63% to $120.52. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a morning low $118.54 to a high $123.16 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested and also held above the 23.6% FIB of $117. For the day ahead, a hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 through the morning would support a bullish day ahead. A move back through the morning high $123.16 would bring the first major resistance level at $124.27 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Litecoin would likely see any upside capped at $126 levels on the day. Failure to hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 could see Litecoin test the first major support level at $112.06 before any recovery. Barring a crypto sell-off later in the day, Litecoin should steer clear of sub-$110 support levels on the day. Ripple’s XRP fell by 1.98% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 3.4% gain from Monday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.39991. Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP fell from an early intraday high $0.41187 to a late morning intraday low $0.38414. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Ripple’s XRP fell through the first major support level at $0.3922. Recovery through the afternoon saw Ripple’s XRP return to $0.4040 levels before sliding back to sub-$0.40 levels. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 0.74% to $0.40288. Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP rose from a morning low $0.39989 to a high $0.40711 before easing back. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on and also fell short of the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164. For the day ahead, a hold onto $0.40 levels through the morning would support further gains later in the day. A move back through the morning high $0.40711 would bring the first major resistance level at $0.4131 into play. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to break through the 23.6 % FIB of $0.4164. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP would likely come up short of $0.42 levels on the day. Failure to move back through the morning high $0.40711 could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse. A fall through to sub-$0.40 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.3854 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of sub-$0.38 support levels on the day.

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 03/07/19," Bitcoin continued its trend-bucking form on Tuesday to end a string of losses at the turn of the quarter. Bitcoin rose by 2.29% on Tuesday. Reversing a 1.48% fall from Monday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,885. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide from a morning high $10,719 to a late morning intraday low $9,728.2. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $10,075 to test support at the 38.2% FIB of $9,734 before bouncing back. Rallying through the afternoon, Bitcoin struck a late intraday high $10,965 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin fell well short of the first major resistance level at $11,218. It was Bitcoin’s first visit to sub-$10,000 levels since 21st June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red across the crypto-board. Leading the way down was Binance Coin, which slid by 3.65%. Also seeing heavy losses were Litecoin (-3.26%), Tron (-2.89%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (-2.59%), and EOS (-2.37%). Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash SV saw more modest losses of 0.84% and 0.48% respectively. For Stellar’s Lumen, things haven’t improved since falling out of the top ten with a 2.16% loss on the day. With Bitcoin bucking the trend to see green on the day, Bitcoin’s dominance moved back to 61% levels. The total crypto market cap recovered from sub-$290 levels on Tuesday to end the day at $313.2bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 2.73% to $11,182 as the bulls look to restore order. Moves within the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a low $10,876 to a high $11,200 before easing back. While leaving the major support and resistance levels untested early on, Bitcoin came within range of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day for the majors. Ethereum tracked Bitcoin early on, with a 1.01% gain. Tron (+0.94%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.03%), and Litecoin (+1.18%) also made solid gains. Bucking the trend in the early hours, however, was Binance Coin with a 0.31% loss. Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to bring the first major resistance level at $11,323.93 into play. Having failed to touch $11,000 levels on Tuesday, the early move should support a bullish day ahead. An early break through the first major resistance level would bring $11,500 levels into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall back through to $10,500 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,087.13 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,000 support levels on the day. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today This article was originally posted on FX Empire"
Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto," In a recent interview on London Real, the Bitcoin and open blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos talked about the wrong type of people entering the digital asset economy, and why many end up staying for different reasons other than price. On the topic of the many hype-based cryptocurrency projects we see today, Antonopoulos said that the industry sometimes attracts the wrong type of crowd into the ecosystem. “It attracts scammers, opportunists, pump and dumpers, and pyramid schemes, and the ICO market enabled a lot of those people to make their own coins.” Andreas said that one of the reasons the ICO craze happened was because Ethereum made it easy for people to build a scalable, secure, transferable, and censorship-resistant blockchain “just by writing 20 lines of code”. But the Mastering Ethereum author said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains “to build platforms to do massive pump and dumps” instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance. However, he did mention that in the long run, “if you can fund start-ups with an international pool of investors, that can change the investment fields”. FOMO is in the air. Newbies are joining the cryptocurrency space and falling prey to scammers.  Please educate your friends and family:– Promises of profit are 100% ponzi– Request to ""recruit"", ""affiliate"" etc are 100% pyramid schemes– ICO/IEO are 99.99% pump-and-dump — Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) June 20, 2019  Regarding the parabolic rises and falls of many crypto assets, Andreas said that “nothing goes exponential without going down”, and that Bitcoin has done this eight times already as “that’s how it grows”. “The reason it grows like this is that there isn’t much in terms of short pressure to hold it down,” he said. “If you’ve got something that has limited supply and you suddenly have a speculative mania that blows up, it will continue to go up in a straight line, which only further fuels the mania. “Until it reaches a point where there simply isn’t anybody else who feels just as enthusiastic and it pauses for a second, the panic just drives [the price] down.” Andreas said that there’s “no difference between speculators and investors” and that they’re just speculating with a different risk profile, with some of them doing so “with very little research and information”. He said that the reason this is bad is that “a lot of good, innocent, and slightly naive people lost a lot of money” and had their lives destroyed because of this. This has a negative effect “as it changes the community” and “causes damage to the community”. “You have a lot of drama that comes up when there’s money on the table – people’s personalities change.” He said that people start taking shortcuts and their ethics become compromised – “power corrupts, money corrupts”. Andreas said that the majority of people first got involved in crypto most likely “because they heard that it’s some kind of investment opportunity”. He made the case that even though many of these people may have first entered the space “because of speculation and mania”, the people who were only motivated by price left during the 2018 crash, with those who stayed “finding other motivations”. He claimed some of the reasons why people stay is because they like the community, they understand the technology, and they may even be “driven by the political implications”. To those people, Andreas said: “Welcome, you may have come because you want to get rich – that’s okay. Now let me tell you about why you should stay because of the technology even after the price crashes.”   The post Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto appeared first on Coin Rivet."
Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date?," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook’s first foray into cryptocurrency is coming – first dubbed ‘Facebook Coin’, then ‘Global Coin’, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It’s at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle – the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don’t have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: “The Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.” So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it’s a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn’t allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves. Is there a darker side to Libra? The post Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date? appeared first on Coin Rivet."
"Market Morning: Swiss Bans Stocks from EU, Bitcoin Breaks Below $10K, USTR Wants More Tariffs"," Switzerland Bans Trading of Swiss Stocks in EU Switzerland is having a row with the European Union, so it decided to ban trading of its stocks on EU exchanges. These include Novartis (NASDAQ:NVS), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGF), and Roche (OTCMKTS:RHHBY) among others. Europe said it would no longer recognize Swiss stock markets as having the same status as those of EU members, so Switzerland ordered the EU exchanges to stop trading Swiss stocks in retribution. CNN is extrapolating that this disagreement has implications for Brexit, but that’s a stretch, given that trading must continue if the European economy is to maintain any semblance of integration and the politicians that get into these sorts of fights want to keep their tax revenues flowing. Sooner or later, probably sooner, new agreements will have to be sketched out by necessity and trading continued. Otherwise, investors will find other ways to buy and sell securities and the political class will be blamed for any losses. SEE: FSD Pharma Gets License to Sell Cannabis for Medical Use Bitcoin Continues To Collapse Bitcoin (BTC-USD) may not be storing value very well, but it sure is providing a lot of opportunities for short term traders to both make and lose a lot of money.  Daily trading volume continues to trend to new record highs, hitting a record $44 billion a day this month as the cryptocurrency appeared to have topped out for a second time since 2017, this time at around $13,775. So far we are down 28.3% in six days, matching the pace of the crash following the high of $20,001.50 reached on December 17, 2017. Six days later back then, Bitcoin had fallen below $12,800 but recovered somewhat until mid January when it began another fall to $9,600. The decline in Bitcoin is leading the decline in other cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) down less than half of Bitcoin’s decline over the last 24 hours. The downward momentum could be feeding on itself while attracting short sellers into the futures markets, meaning a short term bounce may be due, as it was during the last sharp decline at around this time following the last top. This, in turn, could further encourage more short term traders into the market, pushing daily trading volume even higher. As Bitcoin trading volume hits new records, more are using Bitcoin trading software to spot sentiment changes in order to capitalize on price changes. CEO of CryptoMiner Solutions had this to say of the current volatility, “’Buy the fear, sell the greed’ is the name of the trading game. Our auto trading software reflects this daily.” Easier said than done, though successful traders do add to overall price stability by buying low and selling high. USTR Wants More Tariffs on European, Olives, Cheese, Whiskey, because Airplanes If you like to eat pizza with olives from Europe while drinking whiskey and not paying any tariffs, then you’re in for some bad news. The US Trade Representative’s office has released a list of products, including all of the above, that could be hit with taxes in addition to the $21 billion in taxes that were already announced in April. The fight has to do with subsidies for Boeing (NYSE:BA), an American company, and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY), a Dutch company, who both get subsidies from their respective governments, paid for buy their respective taxpayers. So, in order to “level the playing field” each government is threatening to burden their taxpayers even more with more taxes on totally unrelated foods and alcoholic drinks and fruits grown and produced by companies that have absolutely nothing to do with airplanes whatsoever. Talk about getting caught in a crossfire. Speaking of Boeing, 737 Grounding Keeps Dragging On Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has thrown a monkey wrench in the engines of all 737s still grounded, though not literally, as it announced that it will remove all its 737s from its fleet until after October 1 at the earliest. Boeing had earlier estimated that the 737 fleet would be back in the air by September, so Boeing fell 2% on the news yesterday. Defending the move, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told Fox, “Being proactive like this helps us reduce the last-minute cancellations and allows us to rebook our Customers well in advance, so that’s important that we continue to stay ahead of this.” Southwest has already removed 150 daily flights from its schedule. Hong Kongers Break Down Legislature Doors On the 12th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, Hong Kong residents chose to celebrate by bashing in the doors of the legislature and defacing the portraits of politicians who make laws there on behalf of the Communist Party of China. A Union Jack colonial flag, the flag of Hong Kong before it was handed over to China, was draped over the desk of the legislature’s president, and slogans were spray-painted across the building. Hong Kong stocks remain resilient, perhaps rooting for the protesters to keep China’s authorities at bay and maintain whatever is left of liberty on the island. Interestingly, the Hong Kong dollar, pegged to the US dollar, is up half a percent against the US dollar since June 10, a big move for a pegged currency.   The post Market Morning: Swiss Bans Stocks from EU, Bitcoin Breaks Below $10K, USTR Wants More Tariffs appeared first on Market Exclusive."
The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 08/07/19," Bitcoin closed out the week in positive territory, resuming what has been a particularly bullish run since January. Year-to-date Bitcoin has seen just 8 weekly losses, 2 of which came in June. On Sunday, Bitcoin rose by 1.85%, following on from a 2.56% gain on Saturday, to end the day at $11,485. It was a relatively range-bound first half of the day. Bitcoin eased back to a mid-morning intraday low $11,110 before recovering to a late morning high $11,375. The late morning rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 that provided much-needed support through the morning. Falling back from $11,400 levels struck in the middle of the day, Bitcoin slipped through the 23.6% FIB to $11,150 levels before finding support. Bitcoin bounced back to a late intraday high $11,620 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin came up short of the first major resistance level at $11,680.33. For the week, the weekend gains delivered a 6.34% rise for the week ending 7th July. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was green across the board for majors on Sunday. Leading the way on the day were Tron’s TRX and Ethereum, which saw gains of 8.94% and 6.52% respectively. EOS also outperformed Bitcoin on the day, rising by 3.28%. The rest of the pack saw more modest gains. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+1.79%), Ripple’s XRP (+1.81%), Binance Coin (+1.91%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.96%) stood alongside Bitcoin on the day. Litecoin saw the most modest gain of the day, however, rising by 1.71%. For the week, Tron’s TRX led the way, rallying by 10.06% to cement its position in the number 10 spot by market cap. Bucking the trend in the week was Litecoin, which fell by 1.52%. Bitcoin’s dominance held onto 62% levels, having peaked at 63% levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.1%. The total crypto market cap rose from $313.57bn to a high $337.76bn on Thursday before easing back to $330bn levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.39% to $11,440. Moves at the start of the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,547 to a low $11,413. Bitcoin steered clear of the major support and resistance levels early on. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Tron’s TRX bucked the trend early, rising by 0.49% and by 0.29% respectively. The rest of the pack were in the red, with Bitcoin Cash SV leading the way down with a 1.47% loss. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,400 levels to make a move later in the day. A move through the morning high to $11,600 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,700 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Sunday’s high $11,620 and the first major resistance level will likely limit any upside. Failure to hold onto $11,400 levels could see Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. A pullback to $11,200 levels would bring the first major support level at $11,190 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 support levels on the day. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today This article was originally posted on FX Empire"
"Bitcoin may soon go parabolic over $12,000 again"," Bitcoin is once more looking bullish as the world’s biggest decentralised asset has found a new influx of buying support to rally close to 20% in price since the start of July. On a backdrop of global turmoils driven by a narrative of trade tensions, a breakout in the gold and commodities markets, and even US President Donald Trump calling out China and Europe specifically for currency manipulation, could this be the perfect storm for Bitcoin to break past resistance and head upwards to fresh 2019 highs? China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for many years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019  Long-time Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos has reminded the community that governments may soon try and “blame crypto for the currency war”, but “the race to the bottom” for state-backed fiat currencies has little to do with the disruptive asset class. Towards the end of last week, Bitcoin continued to grind to defend its five-figure valuation. Unlike other downward price movements that we have seen of late, Bitcoin’s move down did not include any large-scale sell-offs, but instead a series of mini-dumps taking the price down from $12,000 to $10,000. Since this local bottom was hit, we have seen volumes pick up and buyers come back into the market to drive the price back up to the same level where the ‘controlled’ sell-off began. If Bitcoin can now penetrate through the $12,000-$12,400 level of resistance, the move back up to $14,000 and beyond may be quicker than its initial parabolic rise in late June. If the digitally-scarce asset does decide to rally up from this point, the odds of ever seeing an exchange-traded price of under $10,000 will decrease exponentially as fast as any potential move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency. That is why we are all here.  Anything short of this becomes much less interesting. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 4, 2019    The popular Bitcoin analyst Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano recently outlined his $100,000 Bitcoin target for the end of 2021, but the chances are that if we do see all-time highs broken sooner rather than later, a six-figure valuation for Bitcoin may become a reality quicker than even the most bullish commentators in the space would ever expect.

Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of “digital payment tokens” in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, “will not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.” The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: “(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.”  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. “A digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,” it said."
The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 05/07/19," Bitcoin led the way on Thursday, but this time for all the wrong reasons… Bitcoin tumbled by 6.85% on Thursday. Partially reversing Wednesday’s 10.09% rally to end the day at $11,162.5. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning intraday high $12,065 to a late morning low $11,503. The moves through the morning saw Bitcoin leave the major support and resistance levels untested. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin recovered to an afternoon high $11,922 before taking a hit in the final hour. The final hour sell-off saw Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33. For Bitcoin, the only positive of the day was the avoidance of sub-$11,000 levels for the first time since 29th June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was red for all but one of the top 10 cryptos on Thursday. Bucking the trend on the day was Binance Coin, which rose by 1.23%. It was deep red for the rest of the pack. Ethereum was close behind Bitcoin, sliding by 6.29%, with EOS (-5.62%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-5%) also seeing heavy losses. Things were not much better for Ripple’s XRP and Tron, which fell by 4.47% and 4.7% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin saw more modest losses on the day. While Bitcoin Cash SV fell by 3.44%, Litecoin fell by just 1.8%. The Bitcoin sell-off on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance pulling back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.5% The total crypto market cap fell from a high $338.45bn to end the day at $319.29bn on Thursday, weighed by Bitcoin’s pullback. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.35% to $11,201. Moves in the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $11,005 to a high $11,287 before easing back. Whilst leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 before the pullback. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.71%), EOS (+0.23%) and Ethereum (+0.25%) also found early support. Litecoin and Binance Coin struggled at the start, with losses of 0.56% and 0.6% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to $11,430 levels to support a reversal of Thursday’s losses. A move through to $11,500 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,800 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $11,287. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could touch $12,000 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,430 levels could see Bitcoin take another hit. A fall through the morning low $11,005 would bring the first major support level at $10,790 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $10,417.5 on the day.

"SEC seeks blockchain data provider to monitor risk, improve compliance, and inform policy"," The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is getting ever more serious about blockchain data. While many of the world's governments and politicians focus on Facebook's recently introduced Libra and data sharing among virtual asset providers, the SEC is seeking more data on public blockchains. The requirements listed by the SEC specific that all data is sourced from hosted notes rather than blockchain explorers. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are mandatory, while Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Zcash, EOS, NEO and XRP data are all specified as desirable. In addition, as new blockchains gain increased prominence, the SEC would require support for them. The SEC is seeking full blockchain data from the genesis block or inception and information about any derivative currencies (tokens) affiliated with these blockchains. The required data format is very specific with normalized fields for each included blockchain sourced from on-node data, in its entirety. The minimum fields specified are ticker symbol; send and receive addresses; transaction hash, timestamp and amounts; unspent send and receive balances; transaction fees; confirmations; block hash; and block height. If possible, the SEC also seeks further metadata and chain metrics such as hashing algorithms, hashing power, mining difficulty and rewards, transactions quantity and size, coin supply and blockchain size. The data is expected to be provided directly by the vendor's own node for each blockchain using a secure, encrypted data feed; synced with the network; and run in a secure, controlled environment. The data must also be presented with means to validate its accuracy and completeness and meet the requirements of financial statement audit testing. The contract length will be for one year, followed by four optional 12 month terms. A technical quote and price quote are both required for application. The SEC's deadline for submission by prospective data vendors is 12pm EST on July 11, 2019. "
Making this easy to understand isn’t easy," Having recently read an article on the BBC website purporting to try and explain the importance of blockchain to the world’s economy, I was struck by the intellectual muddiness of these waters and how easy it is to confuse blockchain with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with altcoins. It really is no wonder that the “man on the street” doesn’t understand these things, and consequently these misconceptions have become a real barrier to mainstream adoption. At the heart of blockchain, it really isn’t much more than a ledger or database (dependent on which descriptor you prefer). A blockchain database is unique, however, through its three pillars of being distributed (multiple copies of), being decentralised (no one copy has version control), and immutable (each transaction recorded is unchangeable). Bitcoin was the first blockchain, and as such is frequently referred to when trying to explain or understand blockchain. What the Bitcoin protocol (the underlying rules of the blockchain) solved technically was the double spend problem. This was key to creating a digital cash that was unforgeable. It’s easy to go too far down the rabbit hole on Bitcoin and start looking at the economic programming and proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors, but this takes us away from understanding blockchain. In order to offer a simple explanation of the difference between blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it’s best to use the analogy of the internet and email. Email, it’s widely agreed, was the internet’s first killer app – so email is simply an application built on top of the internet, but the internet offers far more than just email. Similarly, Bitcoin was blockchain’s first killer app, and as such, all cryptocurrency is built on top of a blockchain – but blockchain can do so much more than just cryptocurrency. With blockchain working as a shared ledger and acting as a trusted central source of truth, we can see organisations looking to solve such complex topics as digital identity (Sovrin), supply chain digital transformation (Tradelens), food provenance (IBM Food Trust), and efficiency in the transportation and logistic industry (BITA). Under the cloak of darkness, many companies are aiming to create proof of concepts that can deliver real-world results for their various industries. In time, the cloak will be lifted and we will see which ones have succeeded and, hopefully, which ones have failed and we can learn from. The Bitcoin protocol is slow, but this is not the protocol that would be used in enterprise environments. The Bitcoin protocol is energy hungry (through PoW), but enterprise blockchains would not use PoW as its consensus mechanism. If you’re looking at having a digital form of money, it makes sense that there should be a cost to creating it in the form of energy consumption. If you’re aiming to clean up the luxury goods markets from fakes and rip-offs, a consortia of luxury goods manufacturers and retailers using proof of authority makes sense – it really is a case of horses for courses. The article also discusses the value that many intermediaries have, and this isn’t wrong. There are plenty of middlemen that actually add value to our every day lives, including the basic function of banking to be the trusted custodian of our money. However, there are also plenty of things that commercial banks do that do not add value, and we should take back sovereignty over – international transfers of money for one. Centralised third-party middlemen are not the problem, the degree to which we can trust them to act on our behalf is. The BBC article misunderstands a basic precept about Bitcoin regarding the speed of transactions by comparing it to Mastercard and Visa. A better comparison for Bitcoin is gold, where transaction in the metal takes a long time and costs a lot of money as it’s generally done as a settlement layer at central bank level. One day in the future, I, and many others believe that Bitcoin will be able to be used as simply as Mastercard or Visa is today, but that requires a layer two solution (such as Lightning), and a much more significant market cap that would be in the trillions of dollars. We may be some way from that being a reality at the present time, but that is just a reason why we should make the effort to understand these issues today. The article jumps to talking about problems with other blockchain based currencies, known as altcoins, but without creating a clear distinction from Bitcoin and creating the clarification that there is no “the blockchain”, but actually many different flavours of the same concept. Many of the altcoins, are based upon a token that drives actions on top of the matching blockchain. For example, Ethereum was a new protocol that went live in 2015 and was intended to be a decentralised global computer with the ability to execute smart contracts. Ether was the token created both as a way to raise the initial funds to build the technology and is now the gas that powers it. Ethereum also paved the way for a glut of new tokens created by entrepreneurs (and scammers) on top of the Ethereum protocol, most of which only had a utility within the application built on top of it. Many people have tried to create new cryptocurrencies, some through forks of pre-existing protocols and coins (such as Bitcoin), and some as entirely new protocols. For some of the entrepreneurs that went down this road, it was little more than a way of making themselves rich. However the main problem with the altcoins when trying to be viewed as money, is that they tend to be overly centralised (meaning that the transactions and rules of the currency won’t have as much trust), and look to reduce energy consumption and speed up transaction throughput through different consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated PoS, and tend to lack scarcity – if you understand economics, it’s fairly easy to see that without significant cost and scarcity, there can be no significant value created with respect to money. Again, look at the comparison to finding and excavating gold from the earth. My belief is that in ten years’ time, Bitcoin will have either changed the world we live in or will have become virtually valueless. Conversely, I believe that blockchain is here to stay and will change the world but needs to fade into the background. The reality is that blockchain is still mostly hype, as was the internet in 1994. The industry needs time to develop – just because it’s hype today, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t real world-changing tech there.

"Market Morning: Swiss Bans Stocks from EU, Bitcoin Breaks Below $10K, USTR Wants More Tariffs"," Switzerland Bans Trading of Swiss Stocks in EU Switzerland is having a row with the European Union, so it decided to ban trading of its stocks on EU exchanges. These include Novartis (NASDAQ:NVS), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGF), and Roche (OTCMKTS:RHHBY) among others. Europe said it would no longer recognize Swiss stock markets as having the same status as those of EU members, so Switzerland ordered the EU exchanges to stop trading Swiss stocks in retribution. CNN is extrapolating that this disagreement has implications for Brexit, but that’s a stretch, given that trading must continue if the European economy is to maintain any semblance of integration and the politicians that get into these sorts of fights want to keep their tax revenues flowing. Sooner or later, probably sooner, new agreements will have to be sketched out by necessity and trading continued. Otherwise, investors will find other ways to buy and sell securities and the political class will be blamed for any losses. SEE: FSD Pharma Gets License to Sell Cannabis for Medical Use Bitcoin Continues To Collapse Bitcoin (BTC-USD) may not be storing value very well, but it sure is providing a lot of opportunities for short term traders to both make and lose a lot of money.  Daily trading volume continues to trend to new record highs, hitting a record $44 billion a day this month as the cryptocurrency appeared to have topped out for a second time since 2017, this time at around $13,775. So far we are down 28.3% in six days, matching the pace of the crash following the high of $20,001.50 reached on December 17, 2017. Six days later back then, Bitcoin had fallen below $12,800 but recovered somewhat until mid January when it began another fall to $9,600. The decline in Bitcoin is leading the decline in other cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) down less than half of Bitcoin’s decline over the last 24 hours. The downward momentum could be feeding on itself while attracting short sellers into the futures markets, meaning a short term bounce may be due, as it was during the last sharp decline at around this time following the last top. This, in turn, could further encourage more short term traders into the market, pushing daily trading volume even higher. As Bitcoin trading volume hits new records, more are using Bitcoin trading software to spot sentiment changes in order to capitalize on price changes. CEO of CryptoMiner Solutions had this to say of the current volatility, “’Buy the fear, sell the greed’ is the name of the trading game. Our auto trading software reflects this daily.” Easier said than done, though successful traders do add to overall price stability by buying low and selling high. USTR Wants More Tariffs on European, Olives, Cheese, Whiskey, because Airplanes If you like to eat pizza with olives from Europe while drinking whiskey and not paying any tariffs, then you’re in for some bad news. The US Trade Representative’s office has released a list of products, including all of the above, that could be hit with taxes in addition to the $21 billion in taxes that were already announced in April. The fight has to do with subsidies for Boeing (NYSE:BA), an American company, and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY), a Dutch company, who both get subsidies from their respective governments, paid for buy their respective taxpayers. So, in order to “level the playing field” each government is threatening to burden their taxpayers even more with more taxes on totally unrelated foods and alcoholic drinks and fruits grown and produced by companies that have absolutely nothing to do with airplanes whatsoever. Talk about getting caught in a crossfire. Speaking of Boeing, 737 Grounding Keeps Dragging On Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has thrown a monkey wrench in the engines of all 737s still grounded, though not literally, as it announced that it will remove all its 737s from its fleet until after October 1 at the earliest. Boeing had earlier estimated that the 737 fleet would be back in the air by September, so Boeing fell 2% on the news yesterday. Defending the move, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told Fox, “Being proactive like this helps us reduce the last-minute cancellations and allows us to rebook our Customers well in advance, so that’s important that we continue to stay ahead of this.” Southwest has already removed 150 daily flights from its schedule. Hong Kongers Break Down Legislature Doors On the 12th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, Hong Kong residents chose to celebrate by bashing in the doors of the legislature and defacing the portraits of politicians who make laws there on behalf of the Communist Party of China. A Union Jack colonial flag, the flag of Hong Kong before it was handed over to China, was draped over the desk of the legislature’s president, and slogans were spray-painted across the building. Hong Kong stocks remain resilient, perhaps rooting for the protesters to keep China’s authorities at bay and maintain whatever is left of liberty on the island. Interestingly, the Hong Kong dollar, pegged to the US dollar, is up half a percent against the US dollar since June 10, a big move for a pegged currency.   The post Market Morning: Swiss Bans Stocks from EU, Bitcoin Breaks Below $10K, USTR Wants More Tariffs appeared first on Market Exclusive."

Easing back through the afternoon, Bitcoin Cash ABC slid back to $396 levels before a late recovery to $400 levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 1.13% to $404.5. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $400.67 to a high $404.5. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold above $401.5 would support a run at the first major resistance level at $409.98. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the continued support of the broader market, however, to take a run on Thursday’s high $411.5. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin Cash ABC would likely fall short of recovery through the 23.6% FIB of $418.0.

For the bulls, steering clear of sub-$11,000 levels was key late in the day, supporting a move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,280 levels. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 4.45%, which was also supported by 2.29% and 10.09% gains from Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed start to the weekend. Joining Bitcoin in the green for the day were Ripple’s XRP, which led the way with a 3.08% rally.

Joining Litecoin in the green were EOS (+0.54%), Ethereum (+0.18%) and Binance Coin (+0.02%). Bitcoin Cash ABC joined Bitcoin in the red with a -1.64%, while Bitcoin Cash SV was flat. Bitcoin would need to break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 to $11,320 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $11,680.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $11,720 would likely limit any upside. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,320 levels could see Bitcoin slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $11,111 would bring the first major support level at $10,921.33 into play.

Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of “digital payment tokens” in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, “will not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.” The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: “(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.”  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. “A digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,” it said."

A brief visit to $419 levels was short-lived, with Bitcoin Cash ABC sliding to an intraday low $398.17 in the final hour of the day. The sell-off saw Bitcoin Cash ABC slide through the 23.6% FIB and first major support level at $407.36. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 0.9% to $401.77. A relatively bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $396.33 to a high $402.01. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, Bitcoin Cash ABC would need to move through to $406 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $413.25. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need support from the broader market, however, to break through to $410 levels. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin Cash ABC could take a run at $420 levels. Failure to move through to $406 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC hit reverse. A fall through the morning low $396.33 would bring the first major support level at $390.63 into play. Barring another crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$390 support levels on the day. Litecoin fell by 1.8% on Thursday.

In spite of the sell-off, Litecoin left the first major support level at $118.28 untested on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 0.05% to $119.53. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a low $118.5 to a high $120.14 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move through to $122 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $124.96. Litecoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at Thursday’s high $127.37. An early move through to $125 levels would bring the second major resistance level at $130.34 into play. Failure to move through to $122 levels could see Litecoin fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $118.5 would bring the 23.6% FIB of $117 into play before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Litecoin should steer clear of the first major support level at $116.62. Ripple’s XRP slid by 4.47% on Thursday.

Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP will likely come up short of $0.40 levels on the day. Failure to move through to $0.3935 levels could see Ripple’s XRP fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $0.3844 would bring the first major support level at $0.3802 into play. An extended sell-off through the day could see Ripple’s XRP fall to sub-$0.38 levels before any recovery.

"Market Morning: Swiss Bans Stocks from EU, Bitcoin Breaks Below $10K, USTR Wants More Tariffs"," Switzerland Bans Trading of Swiss Stocks in EU Switzerland is having a row with the European Union, so it decided to ban trading of its stocks on EU exchanges. These include Novartis (NASDAQ:NVS), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGF), and Roche (OTCMKTS:RHHBY) among others. Europe said it would no longer recognize Swiss stock markets as having the same status as those of EU members, so Switzerland ordered the EU exchanges to stop trading Swiss stocks in retribution. CNN is extrapolating that this disagreement has implications for Brexit, but that’s a stretch, given that trading must continue if the European economy is to maintain any semblance of integration and the politicians that get into these sorts of fights want to keep their tax revenues flowing. Sooner or later, probably sooner, new agreements will have to be sketched out by necessity and trading continued. Otherwise, investors will find other ways to buy and sell securities and the political class will be blamed for any losses. SEE: FSD Pharma Gets License to Sell Cannabis for Medical Use Bitcoin Continues To Collapse Bitcoin (BTC-USD) may not be storing value very well, but it sure is providing a lot of opportunities for short term traders to both make and lose a lot of money.  Daily trading volume continues to trend to new record highs, hitting a record $44 billion a day this month as the cryptocurrency appeared to have topped out for a second time since 2017, this time at around $13,775. So far we are down 28.3% in six days, matching the pace of the crash following the high of $20,001.50 reached on December 17, 2017. Six days later back then, Bitcoin had fallen below $12,800 but recovered somewhat until mid January when it began another fall to $9,600. The decline in Bitcoin is leading the decline in other cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) down less than half of Bitcoin’s decline over the last 24 hours. The downward momentum could be feeding on itself while attracting short sellers into the futures markets, meaning a short term bounce may be due, as it was during the last sharp decline at around this time following the last top. This, in turn, could further encourage more short term traders into the market, pushing daily trading volume even higher. As Bitcoin trading volume hits new records, more are using Bitcoin trading software to spot sentiment changes in order to capitalize on price changes. CEO of CryptoMiner Solutions had this to say of the current volatility, “’Buy the fear, sell the greed’ is the name of the trading game. Our auto trading software reflects this daily.” Easier said than done, though successful traders do add to overall price stability by buying low and selling high. USTR Wants More Tariffs on European, Olives, Cheese, Whiskey, because Airplanes If you like to eat pizza with olives from Europe while drinking whiskey and not paying any tariffs, then you’re in for some bad news. The US Trade Representative’s office has released a list of products, including all of the above, that could be hit with taxes in addition to the $21 billion in taxes that were already announced in April. The fight has to do with subsidies for Boeing (NYSE:BA), an American company, and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY), a Dutch company, who both get subsidies from their respective governments, paid for buy their respective taxpayers. So, in order to “level the playing field” each government is threatening to burden their taxpayers even more with more taxes on totally unrelated foods and alcoholic drinks and fruits grown and produced by companies that have absolutely nothing to do with airplanes whatsoever. Talk about getting caught in a crossfire. Speaking of Boeing, 737 Grounding Keeps Dragging On Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has thrown a monkey wrench in the engines of all 737s still grounded, though not literally, as it announced that it will remove all its 737s from its fleet until after October 1 at the earliest. Boeing had earlier estimated that the 737 fleet would be back in the air by September, so Boeing fell 2% on the news yesterday. Defending the move, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told Fox, “Being proactive like this helps us reduce the last-minute cancellations and allows us to rebook our Customers well in advance, so that’s important that we continue to stay ahead of this.” Southwest has already removed 150 daily flights from its schedule. Hong Kongers Break Down Legislature Doors On the 12th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, Hong Kong residents chose to celebrate by bashing in the doors of the legislature and defacing the portraits of politicians who make laws there on behalf of the Communist Party of China. A Union Jack colonial flag, the flag of Hong Kong before it was handed over to China, was draped over the desk of the legislature’s president, and slogans were spray-painted across the building. Hong Kong stocks remain resilient, perhaps rooting for the protesters to keep China’s authorities at bay and maintain whatever is left of liberty on the island. Interestingly, the Hong Kong dollar, pegged to the US dollar, is up half a percent against the US dollar since June 10, a big move for a pegged currency.   The post Market Morning: Swiss Bans Stocks from EU, Bitcoin Breaks Below $10K, USTR Wants More Tariffs appeared first on Market Exclusive."

Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to bring the first major resistance level at $11,323.93 into play. Having failed to touch $11,000 levels on Tuesday, the early move should support a bullish day ahead. An early break through the first major resistance level would bring $11,500 levels into play.

Ethereum Analysis – Support Levels in Play – 03/07/19," It’s been a bearish first half of the week. Following last week’s 2.76% gain, Ethereum was down by 8.13%, Sunday through Tuesday. A bearish start to the week saw Ethereum slide by 8.51% on Sunday to set the tone early on. In spite of finding support on Monday to hold on to $290 levels, with a 1.25% gain, the reversal continued on Tuesday. Ethereum fell by a further 0.84% to end the day at $291.25. Falling from a current week high $323.61 from Sunday, Ethereum fell to a current week low $270.42 on Tuesday. Steering well clear of the first major resistance level at $363.16, Ethereum fell through the first major support level at $272.17 before recovering to $291 levels. While falling back from the 38.2% FIB of $367, Ethereum managed to steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $257. The extended bearish trend, formed at last May 2018’s swing hi $828.97, remained firmly intact, however. Ethereum continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $367, following December’s swing lo $80.6. For the bulls, a breakout from the 38.2% FIB of $367 would be needed to form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 0.67% to $293.19. A move back through to $320 levels would signal a 2nd half of a week rebound. Ethereum would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $300. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, a move through to $320 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $363.16 into play. Barring a crypto rally going into the weekend, however, the first major resistance level and the 38.2% FIB would cap any upside in the event of a bounce back. With volatility returning to the broader market, a break through the 38.2% FIB would bring $400 levels into view. Failure to move through to $320 levels would likely leave Ethereum on the back foot through the week. A fall through the current week low $270.42 could see Ethereum slide through the 23.6% FIB of $257 before any recovery.

To start, the new platform will offer trading of its so-called Bitcoin Perpetual Contract (XBTUSDM).  KuCoin is the latest cryptocurrency exchange to announce its intention to gatecrash the market for cryptocurrency derivatives, a space currently dominated by behemoth BitMEX. Houbi, Binance, and Bitfinex have recently launched or announced the impending launch of their own platforms to trade perpetual swaps, a synthetic way to bet on cryptocurrencies.  As part of its attempt to lure traders to the new venue, KuMEX will offer rebates to certain traders. “At the same time, KuMEX offers a negative fee for Makers at a rate of -0.025% with a certain amount of fixed commission, encouraging users to provide liquidity to the platform through making the market and earning some commission as an incentive,” the press release reads. Furthermore, the platform uses Bitcoin Spot Index that volume-weights the price of bitcoin in six major exchanges—Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, Liquid and Bittrex. According to the press release, by using figures from more exchanges, KuMEX hopes to achieve a more “fair and rigorous” bitcoin index price. Meanwhile, rival BitMEX prices its swaps based on data from a pool of three exchanges.  KuCoin also announced a trading competition, with a reward of 10,000 KCS for users with top scores in their return rate ranking."
"SEC seeks blockchain data provider to monitor risk, improve compliance, and inform policy"," The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is getting ever more serious about blockchain data. While many of the world's governments and politicians focus on Facebook's recently introduced Libra and data sharing among virtual asset providers, the SEC is seeking more data on public blockchains. The requirements listed by the SEC specific that all data is sourced from hosted notes rather than blockchain explorers. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are mandatory, while Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Zcash, EOS, NEO and XRP data are all specified as desirable. In addition, as new blockchains gain increased prominence, the SEC would require support for them. The SEC is seeking full blockchain data from the genesis block or inception and information about any derivative currencies (tokens) affiliated with these blockchains. The required data format is very specific with normalized fields for each included blockchain sourced from on-node data, in its entirety. The minimum fields specified are ticker symbol; send and receive addresses; transaction hash, timestamp and amounts; unspent send and receive balances; transaction fees; confirmations; block hash; and block height. If possible, the SEC also seeks further metadata and chain metrics such as hashing algorithms, hashing power, mining difficulty and rewards, transactions quantity and size, coin supply and blockchain size. The data is expected to be provided directly by the vendor's own node for each blockchain using a secure, encrypted data feed; synced with the network; and run in a secure, controlled environment. The data must also be presented with means to validate its accuracy and completeness and meet the requirements of financial statement audit testing. The contract length will be for one year, followed by four optional 12 month terms. A technical quote and price quote are both required for application. The SEC's deadline for submission by prospective data vendors is 12pm EST on July 11, 2019. "
The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 08/07/19," Bitcoin closed out the week in positive territory, resuming what has been a particularly bullish run since January. Year-to-date Bitcoin has seen just 8 weekly losses, 2 of which came in June. On Sunday, Bitcoin rose by 1.85%, following on from a 2.56% gain on Saturday, to end the day at $11,485. It was a relatively range-bound first half of the day. Bitcoin eased back to a mid-morning intraday low $11,110 before recovering to a late morning high $11,375. The late morning rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 that provided much-needed support through the morning. Falling back from $11,400 levels struck in the middle of the day, Bitcoin slipped through the 23.6% FIB to $11,150 levels before finding support. Bitcoin bounced back to a late intraday high $11,620 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin came up short of the first major resistance level at $11,680.33. For the week, the weekend gains delivered a 6.34% rise for the week ending 7th July. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was green across the board for majors on Sunday. Leading the way on the day were Tron’s TRX and Ethereum, which saw gains of 8.94% and 6.52% respectively. EOS also outperformed Bitcoin on the day, rising by 3.28%. The rest of the pack saw more modest gains. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+1.79%), Ripple’s XRP (+1.81%), Binance Coin (+1.91%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.96%) stood alongside Bitcoin on the day. Litecoin saw the most modest gain of the day, however, rising by 1.71%. For the week, Tron’s TRX led the way, rallying by 10.06% to cement its position in the number 10 spot by market cap. Bucking the trend in the week was Litecoin, which fell by 1.52%. Bitcoin’s dominance held onto 62% levels, having peaked at 63% levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.1%. The total crypto market cap rose from $313.57bn to a high $337.76bn on Thursday before easing back to $330bn levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.39% to $11,440. Moves at the start of the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,547 to a low $11,413. Bitcoin steered clear of the major support and resistance levels early on. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Tron’s TRX bucked the trend early, rising by 0.49% and by 0.29% respectively. The rest of the pack were in the red, with Bitcoin Cash SV leading the way down with a 1.47% loss. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,400 levels to make a move later in the day. A move through the morning high to $11,600 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,700 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Sunday’s high $11,620 and the first major resistance level will likely limit any upside. Failure to hold onto $11,400 levels could see Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. A pullback to $11,200 levels would bring the first major support level at $11,190 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 support levels on the day. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today This article was originally posted on FX Empire"
Making this easy to understand isn’t easy," Having recently read an article on the BBC website purporting to try and explain the importance of blockchain to the world’s economy, I was struck by the intellectual muddiness of these waters and how easy it is to confuse blockchain with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with altcoins. It really is no wonder that the “man on the street” doesn’t understand these things, and consequently these misconceptions have become a real barrier to mainstream adoption. At the heart of blockchain, it really isn’t much more than a ledger or database (dependent on which descriptor you prefer). A blockchain database is unique, however, through its three pillars of being distributed (multiple copies of), being decentralised (no one copy has version control), and immutable (each transaction recorded is unchangeable). Bitcoin was the first blockchain, and as such is frequently referred to when trying to explain or understand blockchain. What the Bitcoin protocol (the underlying rules of the blockchain) solved technically was the double spend problem. This was key to creating a digital cash that was unforgeable. It’s easy to go too far down the rabbit hole on Bitcoin and start looking at the economic programming and proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors, but this takes us away from understanding blockchain. In order to offer a simple explanation of the difference between blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it’s best to use the analogy of the internet and email. Email, it’s widely agreed, was the internet’s first killer app – so email is simply an application built on top of the internet, but the internet offers far more than just email. Similarly, Bitcoin was blockchain’s first killer app, and as such, all cryptocurrency is built on top of a blockchain – but blockchain can do so much more than just cryptocurrency. With blockchain working as a shared ledger and acting as a trusted central source of truth, we can see organisations looking to solve such complex topics as digital identity (Sovrin), supply chain digital transformation (Tradelens), food provenance (IBM Food Trust), and efficiency in the transportation and logistic industry (BITA). Under the cloak of darkness, many companies are aiming to create proof of concepts that can deliver real-world results for their various industries. In time, the cloak will be lifted and we will see which ones have succeeded and, hopefully, which ones have failed and we can learn from. The Bitcoin protocol is slow, but this is not the protocol that would be used in enterprise environments. The Bitcoin protocol is energy hungry (through PoW), but enterprise blockchains would not use PoW as its consensus mechanism. If you’re looking at having a digital form of money, it makes sense that there should be a cost to creating it in the form of energy consumption. If you’re aiming to clean up the luxury goods markets from fakes and rip-offs, a consortia of luxury goods manufacturers and retailers using proof of authority makes sense – it really is a case of horses for courses. The article also discusses the value that many intermediaries have, and this isn’t wrong. There are plenty of middlemen that actually add value to our every day lives, including the basic function of banking to be the trusted custodian of our money. However, there are also plenty of things that commercial banks do that do not add value, and we should take back sovereignty over – international transfers of money for one. Centralised third-party middlemen are not the problem, the degree to which we can trust them to act on our behalf is. The BBC article misunderstands a basic precept about Bitcoin regarding the speed of transactions by comparing it to Mastercard and Visa. A better comparison for Bitcoin is gold, where transaction in the metal takes a long time and costs a lot of money as it’s generally done as a settlement layer at central bank level. One day in the future, I, and many others believe that Bitcoin will be able to be used as simply as Mastercard or Visa is today, but that requires a layer two solution (such as Lightning), and a much more significant market cap that would be in the trillions of dollars. We may be some way from that being a reality at the present time, but that is just a reason why we should make the effort to understand these issues today. The article jumps to talking about problems with other blockchain based currencies, known as altcoins, but without creating a clear distinction from Bitcoin and creating the clarification that there is no “the blockchain”, but actually many different flavours of the same concept. Many of the altcoins, are based upon a token that drives actions on top of the matching blockchain. For example, Ethereum was a new protocol that went live in 2015 and was intended to be a decentralised global computer with the ability to execute smart contracts. Ether was the token created both as a way to raise the initial funds to build the technology and is now the gas that powers it. Ethereum also paved the way for a glut of new tokens created by entrepreneurs (and scammers) on top of the Ethereum protocol, most of which only had a utility within the application built on top of it. Many people have tried to create new cryptocurrencies, some through forks of pre-existing protocols and coins (such as Bitcoin), and some as entirely new protocols. For some of the entrepreneurs that went down this road, it was little more than a way of making themselves rich. However the main problem with the altcoins when trying to be viewed as money, is that they tend to be overly centralised (meaning that the transactions and rules of the currency won’t have as much trust), and look to reduce energy consumption and speed up transaction throughput through different consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated PoS, and tend to lack scarcity – if you understand economics, it’s fairly easy to see that without significant cost and scarcity, there can be no significant value created with respect to money. Again, look at the comparison to finding and excavating gold from the earth. My belief is that in ten years’ time, Bitcoin will have either changed the world we live in or will have become virtually valueless. Conversely, I believe that blockchain is here to stay and will change the world but needs to fade into the background. The reality is that blockchain is still mostly hype, as was the internet in 1994. The industry needs time to develop – just because it’s hype today, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t real world-changing tech there.

The Top 5 cryptocurrencies latest price," Today the price of Bitcoin is US$$11,158.25; Ethereum is US$290.43; XRP is US$0.389770; Bitcoin Cash is US$401.86 and Litecoin is US$119.90. These are the Top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. The top 5 cryptocurrencies are the biggest and most significant cryptocurrencies and constitute the top half of The Top 10 Cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. In August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are. The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without “relying on trust”. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number “0” (or the “genesis block”) which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) developed by the Ripple company. It is also referred to as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol. It can trace its roots to 2004 when a web developer called Ryan Fugger had the idea to create a monetary system that was decentralised and could effectively allow individuals to create their own money. Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on 30th July 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a white paper in 2013 describing Ethereum. Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn’t get buy-in to his proposal. Bitcoin Cash was born out of the idea of making Bitcoin more practical for small, day-to-day payments. In May 2017, Bitcoin payments took about four days unless a fee was paid, which was proportionately too large for small transactions. A change to the code was implemented and Bitcoin Cash was born on 1st August 2017. Litecoin was released in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee. It was a fork of Bitcoin with the main difference being a smaller block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, and a different script-based algorithm.

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 05/07/19," Bitcoin led the way on Thursday, but this time for all the wrong reasons… Bitcoin tumbled by 6.85% on Thursday. Partially reversing Wednesday’s 10.09% rally to end the day at $11,162.5. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning intraday high $12,065 to a late morning low $11,503. The moves through the morning saw Bitcoin leave the major support and resistance levels untested. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin recovered to an afternoon high $11,922 before taking a hit in the final hour. The final hour sell-off saw Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33. For Bitcoin, the only positive of the day was the avoidance of sub-$11,000 levels for the first time since 29th June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was red for all but one of the top 10 cryptos on Thursday. Bucking the trend on the day was Binance Coin, which rose by 1.23%. It was deep red for the rest of the pack. Ethereum was close behind Bitcoin, sliding by 6.29%, with EOS (-5.62%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-5%) also seeing heavy losses. Things were not much better for Ripple’s XRP and Tron, which fell by 4.47% and 4.7% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin saw more modest losses on the day. While Bitcoin Cash SV fell by 3.44%, Litecoin fell by just 1.8%. The Bitcoin sell-off on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance pulling back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.5% The total crypto market cap fell from a high $338.45bn to end the day at $319.29bn on Thursday, weighed by Bitcoin’s pullback. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.35% to $11,201. Moves in the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $11,005 to a high $11,287 before easing back. Whilst leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 before the pullback. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.71%), EOS (+0.23%) and Ethereum (+0.25%) also found early support. Litecoin and Binance Coin struggled at the start, with losses of 0.56% and 0.6% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to $11,430 levels to support a reversal of Thursday’s losses. A move through to $11,500 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,800 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $11,287. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could touch $12,000 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,430 levels could see Bitcoin take another hit. A fall through the morning low $11,005 would bring the first major support level at $10,790 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $10,417.5 on the day.

"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 03/07/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC fell by 2.59% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 4.11% gain from Monday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $408.02. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall from an early intraday high $418.87 to a late morning intraday low $383.16. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the 23.6% FIB of $418 and the first major support level at $394.38. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin Cash ABC recovered to $400 levels to limit the loss on the day. In spite of the partial recovery, Bitcoin Cash ABC was unable to move back through the 23.6% FIB… At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 1.1% to $412.50. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $408.41 to a high $418.0. Whilst falling short of the first major resistance level at $423.54, the 23.6% FIB of $418 continued to limit progress. For the day ahead, Bitcoin Cash ABC would need to steer clear of sub-$410 levels to support another run at the first major resistance level at $423.54. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the 23.6% FIB of $418. An extended crypto rally through the day could see Bitcoin Cash ABC test the second major resistance level at $439.06. Failure to avoid sub-$410 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC slide back through to sub-$400 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, the first major support level at $387.87 should limit any downside on the day. Litecoin slid by 3.26% on Tuesday. Reversing a 0.42% gain from Monday with interest, Litecoin ended the day at $118.59. A particularly bearish morning saw Litecoin slide from an intraday high $123.41 to a mid-morning intraday low $111.2. The reversal saw Litecoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $117 and the first major support level at $114.94. Finding support through the afternoon, Litecoin managed a brief return to $120 levels before easing back. The 23.6% FIB proved to be the resistance line on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 1.63% to $120.52. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a morning low $118.54 to a high $123.16 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested and also held above the 23.6% FIB of $117. For the day ahead, a hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 through the morning would support a bullish day ahead. A move back through the morning high $123.16 would bring the first major resistance level at $124.27 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Litecoin would likely see any upside capped at $126 levels on the day. Failure to hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 could see Litecoin test the first major support level at $112.06 before any recovery. Barring a crypto sell-off later in the day, Litecoin should steer clear of sub-$110 support levels on the day. Ripple’s XRP fell by 1.98% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 3.4% gain from Monday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.39991. Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP fell from an early intraday high $0.41187 to a late morning intraday low $0.38414. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Ripple’s XRP fell through the first major support level at $0.3922. Recovery through the afternoon saw Ripple’s XRP return to $0.4040 levels before sliding back to sub-$0.40 levels. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 0.74% to $0.40288. Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP rose from a morning low $0.39989 to a high $0.40711 before easing back. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on and also fell short of the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164. For the day ahead, a hold onto $0.40 levels through the morning would support further gains later in the day. A move back through the morning high $0.40711 would bring the first major resistance level at $0.4131 into play. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to break through the 23.6 % FIB of $0.4164. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP would likely come up short of $0.42 levels on the day. Failure to move back through the morning high $0.40711 could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse. A fall through to sub-$0.40 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.3854 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of sub-$0.38 support levels on the day.

Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of “digital payment tokens” in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, “will not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.” The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: “(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.”  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. “A digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,” it said."
Non-custodial crypto wallet ZenGo adding support for Facebook’s Libra coin," ZenGo, a provider of non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, is adding support for Facebook's upcoming cryptocurrency Libra, according to an announcement Tuesday. The firm has released a proof-of-concept for Libra testnet, using a cryptographic technique called threshold signatures scheme (TSS), which helps create a secure and easy-to-use transaction process. ""TSS removes the burden of the single atomic private key and splits the responsibility between multiple parties. Each of the parties generates its own secret and uses this secret to distributively sign a transaction without revealing the secret to the other parties,"" ZenGo explained. Facebook's crypto subsidiary, Calibra, will be launching a default custodial wallet for storing Libra, but that could hinder mass adoption of the cryptocurrency because users would have to trust Calibra to store their coins, ZenGo CEO, Ouriel Ohayon, told The Block. ""True ownership comes with non-custodial options which Libra seems to encourage too. The challenge is to get a large number of users unfamiliar with security, key management and complex backup process to cross that path. It's great to see that developers can build true non-custodial Calibra alternatives where users control their funds,"" Ohayon added. ZenGo wallet currently supports bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) cryptocurrencies. It is currently also preparing to add support for Binance's BNB, Zilliqa's ZIL and Tezos' XTZ tokens, with more cryptocurrencies planned for the future, per the announcement. ZenGo recently raised $4 million from investors including Samsung and Benson Oak Ventures, aiming to simplify the process of storing and managing cryptocurrencies for common men."
Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto," In a recent interview on London Real, the Bitcoin and open blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos talked about the wrong type of people entering the digital asset economy, and why many end up staying for different reasons other than price. On the topic of the many hype-based cryptocurrency projects we see today, Antonopoulos said that the industry sometimes attracts the wrong type of crowd into the ecosystem. “It attracts scammers, opportunists, pump and dumpers, and pyramid schemes, and the ICO market enabled a lot of those people to make their own coins.” Andreas said that one of the reasons the ICO craze happened was because Ethereum made it easy for people to build a scalable, secure, transferable, and censorship-resistant blockchain “just by writing 20 lines of code”. But the Mastering Ethereum author said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains “to build platforms to do massive pump and dumps” instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance. However, he did mention that in the long run, “if you can fund start-ups with an international pool of investors, that can change the investment fields”. FOMO is in the air. Newbies are joining the cryptocurrency space and falling prey to scammers.  Please educate your friends and family:– Promises of profit are 100% ponzi– Request to ""recruit"", ""affiliate"" etc are 100% pyramid schemes– ICO/IEO are 99.99% pump-and-dump — Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) June 20, 2019  Regarding the parabolic rises and falls of many crypto assets, Andreas said that “nothing goes exponential without going down”, and that Bitcoin has done this eight times already as “that’s how it grows”. “The reason it grows like this is that there isn’t much in terms of short pressure to hold it down,” he said. “If you’ve got something that has limited supply and you suddenly have a speculative mania that blows up, it will continue to go up in a straight line, which only further fuels the mania. “Until it reaches a point where there simply isn’t anybody else who feels just as enthusiastic and it pauses for a second, the panic just drives [the price] down.” Andreas said that there’s “no difference between speculators and investors” and that they’re just speculating with a different risk profile, with some of them doing so “with very little research and information”. He said that the reason this is bad is that “a lot of good, innocent, and slightly naive people lost a lot of money” and had their lives destroyed because of this. This has a negative effect “as it changes the community” and “causes damage to the community”. “You have a lot of drama that comes up when there’s money on the table – people’s personalities change.” He said that people start taking shortcuts and their ethics become compromised – “power corrupts, money corrupts”. Andreas said that the majority of people first got involved in crypto most likely “because they heard that it’s some kind of investment opportunity”. He made the case that even though many of these people may have first entered the space “because of speculation and mania”, the people who were only motivated by price left during the 2018 crash, with those who stayed “finding other motivations”. He claimed some of the reasons why people stay is because they like the community, they understand the technology, and they may even be “driven by the political implications”. To those people, Andreas said: “Welcome, you may have come because you want to get rich – that’s okay. Now let me tell you about why you should stay because of the technology even after the price crashes.”   The post Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto appeared first on Coin Rivet."
The Crypto Week – Bitcoin Leads the Way in a Mixed Week for the Majors," While the Bitcoin bulls continued to maintain control, its been another mixed week for the rest of the pack. Bitcoin rose by 2.56% on Saturday. Reversing a 1.42% fall from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,281. On the day, a bullish start to the morning saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,961 to a morning high $11,594 before easing back. The early rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major resistance level at $11,378. Following a relatively range-bound late morning, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $11,720. Falling short of the second major resistance level at $11,753, slid back through the 23.6% FIB to a 2nd half of a day low $11,066. For the bulls, steering clear of sub-$11,000 levels was key late in the day, supporting a move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,280 levels.

Bitcoin Tech Analysis – Recap and Mid-Day Review – 04/07/19," Bitcoin rallied by 10.09% on Wednesday. Following on from a 2.29% gain on Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,983. A bullish start to the day set the tone, with Bitcoin on the move from the start of the day. Bitcoin rallied from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. The moves through the early hours saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and the first major resistance level at $11,762.87. A pullback to sub-$11,000 levels by late morning saw Bitcoin steer clear of the first major support level at $10,087.13 before a late rally. The late rally saw Bitcoin break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275, first major resistance level at $11,323.93, and second major resistance level at $11,762.87 to hit an intraday high $12,025. Resistance at $12,000 limited the upside on the day. The Bitcoin rally led to Bitcoin’s dominance rising back to 62% levels. Bitcoin’s market cap jumped to a Wednesday high $213.5bn before easing back. Bitcoin ultimately provided support to the broader crypto market, leading the majors into positive territory on the day. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December’s swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin continued to find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Wednesday’s rally was another day of correlation with the more mature markets. The rally kicked in well ahead of economic data out of the U.S, however. Weak U.S stats continued to support the FED’s projected rate cut later in the day year. While the cheaper cost of funds is a boon for riskier assets, the current interest rate environment continues to be supportive. A negative for Bitcoin and the broader market continues to be the prospect of a material shift in the regulatory landscape. There’s also the pending SEC decisions on the Bitcoin ETFs to consider. The recent volatility across the broader market has come at the wrong time for those hoping for Bitcoin ETFs to be approved. The good news, however, is the fact that there have been no headline cases of exchanges being hacked… Another piece of good news is the fact that the planned launch of Facebook’s Libra has done no damage just yet… At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.63% to $11,787. In the early part of the day, Bitcoin rose to a start of a day high $12,065 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,379.33, Bitcoin fell back to a late morning low $11,503. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33, Bitcoin moved back through to $11,700 levels. For the Bitcoin bulls, $12,000 looks to be the line in the sand. A hold onto $11,700 levels through the early afternoon would support a move back through to $11,900 levels. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $12,065. In the event of a breakout, the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 would come into play before any pullback. Failure to hold onto $11,700 levels could see Bitcoin slide back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Barring an extended sell-off through the afternoon, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit the downside. In the event of a sell-off, expect a return to sub-$11,000 levels before finding support.

Casa rolls out cryptocurrency mobile app to attract bitcoin novices," Cryptocurrency custody startup Casa has rolled out a new mobile app.  Sats App is a noncustodial wallet that allows users to manage their lightning nodes straight from their mobile phone, CoinDesk writes. Casa is planning to add a rewards program to attract more cryptocurrency early adopters, who can earn cryptocurrency and learn about cryptocurrencies and node management. “Features are focused on increasing adoption of bitcoin and lightning nodes,” said Casa CEO Jeremy Welch. “You will be able to earn bitcoin if you don’t have a Casa node, but you will be able to earn bitcoin faster if you have a node.” The app will currently be available only to Casa customers, with a full roll-out planned for later this month. According to Welch, although the app is “lightweight,” it offers multiple actions — earning sats and operating a full node. “It’s private, secure and connects over Tor,” he added. Earlier this year, Casa announced a “core shift” to its business, launching the Keymaster mobile app and plug-and-play Bitcoin Lightning node Casa Node. "
"Bitcoin may soon go parabolic over $12,000 again"," Bitcoin is once more looking bullish as the world’s biggest decentralised asset has found a new influx of buying support to rally close to 20% in price since the start of July. On a backdrop of global turmoils driven by a narrative of trade tensions, a breakout in the gold and commodities markets, and even US President Donald Trump calling out China and Europe specifically for currency manipulation, could this be the perfect storm for Bitcoin to break past resistance and head upwards to fresh 2019 highs? China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for many years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019  Long-time Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos has reminded the community that governments may soon try and “blame crypto for the currency war”, but “the race to the bottom” for state-backed fiat currencies has little to do with the disruptive asset class. Towards the end of last week, Bitcoin continued to grind to defend its five-figure valuation. Unlike other downward price movements that we have seen of late, Bitcoin’s move down did not include any large-scale sell-offs, but instead a series of mini-dumps taking the price down from $12,000 to $10,000. Since this local bottom was hit, we have seen volumes pick up and buyers come back into the market to drive the price back up to the same level where the ‘controlled’ sell-off began. If Bitcoin can now penetrate through the $12,000-$12,400 level of resistance, the move back up to $14,000 and beyond may be quicker than its initial parabolic rise in late June. If the digitally-scarce asset does decide to rally up from this point, the odds of ever seeing an exchange-traded price of under $10,000 will decrease exponentially as fast as any potential move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency. That is why we are all here.  Anything short of this becomes much less interesting. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 4, 2019    The popular Bitcoin analyst Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano recently outlined his $100,000 Bitcoin target for the end of 2021, but the chances are that if we do see all-time highs broken sooner rather than later, a six-figure valuation for Bitcoin may become a reality quicker than even the most bullish commentators in the space would ever expect.

Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date?," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook’s first foray into cryptocurrency is coming – first dubbed ‘Facebook Coin’, then ‘Global Coin’, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It’s at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle – the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don’t have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: “The Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.” So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it’s a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn’t allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves. Is there a darker side to Libra? The post Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date? appeared first on Coin Rivet."
Coinsquare buys majority stake in Just Cash in bid to make world’s ATMs crypto-friendly," Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinsquare is making a bid to make digital assets more accessible.  Coinsquare has announced it has made a controlling investment in software provider Just Cash, whose tech will allow any ATM to sell cryptocurrency. The software does not disrupt the ATM network, no hardware changes are required and there are no additional costs to the operator. Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond believes crypto-friendly ATMs are key to making digital assets accessible to the masses.  “Right now, there is a lack of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption because most people are intimidated by the process to acquire it,” said Diamond. “By using the millions of existing ATMs around the world, we can now bridge the gap and give new users the easiest and most familiar experience to purchase cryptocurrency.”"

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 05/07/19," Bitcoin led the way on Thursday, but this time for all the wrong reasons… Bitcoin tumbled by 6.85% on Thursday. Partially reversing Wednesday’s 10.09% rally to end the day at $11,162.5. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning intraday high $12,065 to a late morning low $11,503. The moves through the morning saw Bitcoin leave the major support and resistance levels untested. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin recovered to an afternoon high $11,922 before taking a hit in the final hour. The final hour sell-off saw Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33. For Bitcoin, the only positive of the day was the avoidance of sub-$11,000 levels for the first time since 29th June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was red for all but one of the top 10 cryptos on Thursday. Bucking the trend on the day was Binance Coin, which rose by 1.23%. It was deep red for the rest of the pack. Ethereum was close behind Bitcoin, sliding by 6.29%, with EOS (-5.62%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-5%) also seeing heavy losses. Things were not much better for Ripple’s XRP and Tron, which fell by 4.47% and 4.7% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin saw more modest losses on the day. While Bitcoin Cash SV fell by 3.44%, Litecoin fell by just 1.8%. The Bitcoin sell-off on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance pulling back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.5% The total crypto market cap fell from a high $338.45bn to end the day at $319.29bn on Thursday, weighed by Bitcoin’s pullback. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.35% to $11,201. Moves in the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $11,005 to a high $11,287 before easing back. Whilst leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 before the pullback. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.71%), EOS (+0.23%) and Ethereum (+0.25%) also found early support. Litecoin and Binance Coin struggled at the start, with losses of 0.56% and 0.6% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to $11,430 levels to support a reversal of Thursday’s losses. A move through to $11,500 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,800 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $11,287. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could touch $12,000 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,430 levels could see Bitcoin take another hit. A fall through the morning low $11,005 would bring the first major support level at $10,790 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $10,417.5 on the day.

Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date?," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook’s first foray into cryptocurrency is coming – first dubbed ‘Facebook Coin’, then ‘Global Coin’, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It’s at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle – the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don’t have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: “The Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.” So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it’s a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn’t allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves.

The Crypto Week – Bitcoin Leads the Way in a Mixed Week for the Majors," While the Bitcoin bulls continued to maintain control, its been another mixed week for the rest of the pack. Bitcoin rose by 2.56% on Saturday. Reversing a 1.42% fall from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,281. On the day, a bullish start to the morning saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,961 to a morning high $11,594 before easing back. The early rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major resistance level at $11,378. Following a relatively range-bound late morning, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $11,720. Falling short of the second major resistance level at $11,753, slid back through the 23.6% FIB to a 2nd half of a day low $11,066. For the bulls, steering clear of sub-$11,000 levels was key late in the day, supporting a move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,280 levels. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 4.45%, which was also supported by 2.29% and 10.09% gains from Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed start to the weekend. Joining Bitcoin in the green for the day were Ripple’s XRP, which led the way with a 3.08% rally. Bitcoin Cash ABC and EOS also ended the day in the green, with gains of 1.59% and 0.19% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.2%), Litecoin (-0.18%), Binance Coin (-0.15%) and Ethereum (-0.09%) saw red on the day, while Tron ended the day flat. For the current week, Bitcoin led the way with its 4.45%, Monday through Saturday. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.7%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+2.33%), and Binance Coin (+2.04%) also saw solid gains. Tron’s TRX and EOS were also in the green with 1.26% and 0.05% gains respectively. Bucking the trend on the week were Litecoin and Ethereum, which were down by 3.1% and by 0.87% respectively. Another choppy week saw the total crypto market cap recover from a Tuesday current week low $288.64bn to a current week high $337.76bn. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $320.33bn. 24-hour trading volumes were on the slide, however. Falling back from $99bn levels on Wednesday, 24-hour trading volumes stood at $62.72bn at the time of writing. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.55% to $11,219. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,276 to a low $11,111 before finding support. Whilst steering clear of the major support and resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, Litecoin recovered from early losses to move into the green, up by 0.06% at the time of writing. Joining Litecoin in the green were EOS (+0.54%), Ethereum (+0.18%) and Binance Coin (+0.02%). Bitcoin Cash ABC joined Bitcoin in the red with a -1.64%, while Bitcoin Cash SV was flat. Bitcoin would need to break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 to $11,320 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $11,680.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $11,720 would likely limit any upside. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,320 levels could see Bitcoin slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $11,111 would bring the first major support level at $10,921.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,900 levels on the day. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today This article was originally posted on FX Empire"
The Top 5 cryptocurrencies latest price," Today the price of Bitcoin is US$$11,158.25; Ethereum is US$290.43; XRP is US$0.389770; Bitcoin Cash is US$401.86 and Litecoin is US$119.90. These are the Top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. The top 5 cryptocurrencies are the biggest and most significant cryptocurrencies and constitute the top half of The Top 10 Cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. In August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are. The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without “relying on trust”. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number “0” (or the “genesis block”) which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) developed by the Ripple company. It is also referred to as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol. It can trace its roots to 2004 when a web developer called Ryan Fugger had the idea to create a monetary system that was decentralised and could effectively allow individuals to create their own money. Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on 30th July 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a white paper in 2013 describing Ethereum. Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn’t get buy-in to his proposal. Bitcoin Cash was born out of the idea of making Bitcoin more practical for small, day-to-day payments. In May 2017, Bitcoin payments took about four days unless a fee was paid, which was proportionately too large for small transactions. A change to the code was implemented and Bitcoin Cash was born on 1st August 2017. Litecoin was released in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee. It was a fork of Bitcoin with the main difference being a smaller block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, and a different script-based algorithm.

"Bitcoin may soon go parabolic over $12,000 again"," Bitcoin is once more looking bullish as the world’s biggest decentralised asset has found a new influx of buying support to rally close to 20% in price since the start of July. On a backdrop of global turmoils driven by a narrative of trade tensions, a breakout in the gold and commodities markets, and even US President Donald Trump calling out China and Europe specifically for currency manipulation, could this be the perfect storm for Bitcoin to break past resistance and head upwards to fresh 2019 highs? China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for many years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019  Long-time Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos has reminded the community that governments may soon try and “blame crypto for the currency war”, but “the race to the bottom” for state-backed fiat currencies has little to do with the disruptive asset class. Towards the end of last week, Bitcoin continued to grind to defend its five-figure valuation. Unlike other downward price movements that we have seen of late, Bitcoin’s move down did not include any large-scale sell-offs, but instead a series of mini-dumps taking the price down from $12,000 to $10,000. Since this local bottom was hit, we have seen volumes pick up and buyers come back into the market to drive the price back up to the same level where the ‘controlled’ sell-off began. If Bitcoin can now penetrate through the $12,000-$12,400 level of resistance, the move back up to $14,000 and beyond may be quicker than its initial parabolic rise in late June. If the digitally-scarce asset does decide to rally up from this point, the odds of ever seeing an exchange-traded price of under $10,000 will decrease exponentially as fast as any potential move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency. That is why we are all here.  Anything short of this becomes much less interesting. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 4, 2019    The popular Bitcoin analyst Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano recently outlined his $100,000 Bitcoin target for the end of 2021, but the chances are that if we do see all-time highs broken sooner rather than later, a six-figure valuation for Bitcoin may become a reality quicker than even the most bullish commentators in the space would ever expect.

Bitcoin's previous all-time high hash rate was reached on June 29, 2019, at 68.6 million tera hashes per second."
Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of “digital payment tokens” in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, “will not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.” The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: “(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.”  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. “A digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,” it said."
Non-custodial crypto wallet ZenGo adding support for Facebook’s Libra coin," ZenGo, a provider of non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, is adding support for Facebook's upcoming cryptocurrency Libra, according to an announcement Tuesday. The firm has released a proof-of-concept for Libra testnet, using a cryptographic technique called threshold signatures scheme (TSS), which helps create a secure and easy-to-use transaction process. ""TSS removes the burden of the single atomic private key and splits the responsibility between multiple parties. Each of the parties generates its own secret and uses this secret to distributively sign a transaction without revealing the secret to the other parties,"" ZenGo explained. Facebook's crypto subsidiary, Calibra, will be launching a default custodial wallet for storing Libra, but that could hinder mass adoption of the cryptocurrency because users would have to trust Calibra to store their coins, ZenGo CEO, Ouriel Ohayon, told The Block. ""True ownership comes with non-custodial options which Libra seems to encourage too. The challenge is to get a large number of users unfamiliar with security, key management and complex backup process to cross that path. It's great to see that developers can build true non-custodial Calibra alternatives where users control their funds,"" Ohayon added. ZenGo wallet currently supports bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) cryptocurrencies. It is currently also preparing to add support for Binance's BNB, Zilliqa's ZIL and Tezos' XTZ tokens, with more cryptocurrencies planned for the future, per the announcement. ZenGo recently raised $4 million from investors including Samsung and Benson Oak Ventures, aiming to simplify the process of storing and managing cryptocurrencies for common men."
Coinsquare buys majority stake in Just Cash in bid to make world’s ATMs crypto-friendly," Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinsquare is making a bid to make digital assets more accessible.  Coinsquare has announced it has made a controlling investment in software provider Just Cash, whose tech will allow any ATM to sell cryptocurrency. The software does not disrupt the ATM network, no hardware changes are required and there are no additional costs to the operator. Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond believes crypto-friendly ATMs are key to making digital assets accessible to the masses.  “Right now, there is a lack of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption because most people are intimidated by the process to acquire it,” said Diamond. “By using the millions of existing ATMs around the world, we can now bridge the gap and give new users the easiest and most familiar experience to purchase cryptocurrency.”"
The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 03/07/19," Bitcoin continued its trend-bucking form on Tuesday to end a string of losses at the turn of the quarter. Bitcoin rose by 2.29% on Tuesday. Reversing a 1.48% fall from Monday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,885. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide from a morning high $10,719 to a late morning intraday low $9,728.2. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $10,075 to test support at the 38.2% FIB of $9,734 before bouncing back. Rallying through the afternoon, Bitcoin struck a late intraday high $10,965 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin fell well short of the first major resistance level at $11,218. It was Bitcoin’s first visit to sub-$10,000 levels since 21st June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red across the crypto-board. Leading the way down was Binance Coin, which slid by 3.65%. Also seeing heavy losses were Litecoin (-3.26%), Tron (-2.89%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (-2.59%), and EOS (-2.37%). Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash SV saw more modest losses of 0.84% and 0.48% respectively. For Stellar’s Lumen, things haven’t improved since falling out of the top ten with a 2.16% loss on the day. With Bitcoin bucking the trend to see green on the day, Bitcoin’s dominance moved back to 61% levels. The total crypto market cap recovered from sub-$290 levels on Tuesday to end the day at $313.2bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 2.73% to $11,182 as the bulls look to restore order. Moves within the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a low $10,876 to a high $11,200 before easing back. While leaving the major support and resistance levels untested early on, Bitcoin came within range of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day for the majors. Ethereum tracked Bitcoin early on, with a 1.01% gain. Tron (+0.94%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.03%), and Litecoin (+1.18%) also made solid gains. Bucking the trend in the early hours, however, was Binance Coin with a 0.31% loss. Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to bring the first major resistance level at $11,323.93 into play. Having failed to touch $11,000 levels on Tuesday, the early move should support a bullish day ahead. An early break through the first major resistance level would bring $11,500 levels into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall back through to $10,500 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,087.13 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,000 support levels on the day. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today This article was originally posted on FX Empire"
Casa rolls out cryptocurrency mobile app to attract bitcoin novices," Cryptocurrency custody startup Casa has rolled out a new mobile app.  Sats App is a noncustodial wallet that allows users to manage their lightning nodes straight from their mobile phone, CoinDesk writes. Casa is planning to add a rewards program to attract more cryptocurrency early adopters, who can earn cryptocurrency and learn about cryptocurrencies and node management. “Features are focused on increasing adoption of bitcoin and lightning nodes,” said Casa CEO Jeremy Welch. “You will be able to earn bitcoin if you don’t have a Casa node, but you will be able to earn bitcoin faster if you have a node.” The app will currently be available only to Casa customers, with a full roll-out planned for later this month. According to Welch, although the app is “lightweight,” it offers multiple actions — earning sats and operating a full node. “It’s private, secure and connects over Tor,” he added. Earlier this year, Casa announced a “core shift” to its business, launching the Keymaster mobile app and plug-and-play Bitcoin Lightning node Casa Node. "
"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 03/07/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC fell by 2.59% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 4.11% gain from Monday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $408.02. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall from an early intraday high $418.87 to a late morning intraday low $383.16. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the 23.6% FIB of $418 and the first major support level at $394.38. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin Cash ABC recovered to $400 levels to limit the loss on the day. In spite of the partial recovery, Bitcoin Cash ABC was unable to move back through the 23.6% FIB… At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 1.1% to $412.50. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $408.41 to a high $418.0. Whilst falling short of the first major resistance level at $423.54, the 23.6% FIB of $418 continued to limit progress. For the day ahead, Bitcoin Cash ABC would need to steer clear of sub-$410 levels to support another run at the first major resistance level at $423.54. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the 23.6% FIB of $418. An extended crypto rally through the day could see Bitcoin Cash ABC test the second major resistance level at $439.06. Failure to avoid sub-$410 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC slide back through to sub-$400 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, the first major support level at $387.87 should limit any downside on the day. Litecoin slid by 3.26% on Tuesday. Reversing a 0.42% gain from Monday with interest, Litecoin ended the day at $118.59. A particularly bearish morning saw Litecoin slide from an intraday high $123.41 to a mid-morning intraday low $111.2. The reversal saw Litecoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $117 and the first major support level at $114.94. Finding support through the afternoon, Litecoin managed a brief return to $120 levels before easing back. The 23.6% FIB proved to be the resistance line on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 1.63% to $120.52. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a morning low $118.54 to a high $123.16 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested and also held above the 23.6% FIB of $117. For the day ahead, a hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 through the morning would support a bullish day ahead. A move back through the morning high $123.16 would bring the first major resistance level at $124.27 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Litecoin would likely see any upside capped at $126 levels on the day. Failure to hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 could see Litecoin test the first major support level at $112.06 before any recovery.

Recovery through the afternoon saw Ripple’s XRP return to $0.4040 levels before sliding back to sub-$0.40 levels. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 0.74% to $0.40288. Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP rose from a morning low $0.39989 to a high $0.40711 before easing back. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on and also fell short of the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164. For the day ahead, a hold onto $0.40 levels through the morning would support further gains later in the day. A move back through the morning high $0.40711 would bring the first major resistance level at $0.4131 into play. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to break through the 23.6 % FIB of $0.4164. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP would likely come up short of $0.42 levels on the day. Failure to move back through the morning high $0.40711 could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse. A fall through to sub-$0.40 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.3854 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of sub-$0.38 support levels on the day.

Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of “digital payment tokens” in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, “will not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.” The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: “(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.”  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. “A digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,” it said."

A bullish start to the day set the tone, with Bitcoin on the move from the start of the day. Bitcoin rallied from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. The moves through the early hours saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and the first major resistance level at $11,762.87. A pullback to sub-$11,000 levels by late morning saw Bitcoin steer clear of the first major support level at $10,087.13 before a late rally. The late rally saw Bitcoin break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275, first major resistance level at $11,323.93, and second major resistance level at $11,762.87 to hit an intraday high $12,025. Resistance at $12,000 limited the upside on the day. The Bitcoin rally led to Bitcoin’s dominance rising back to 62% levels. Bitcoin’s market cap jumped to a Wednesday high $213.5bn before easing back. Bitcoin ultimately provided support to the broader crypto market, leading the majors into positive territory on the day. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December’s swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin continued to find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Wednesday’s rally was another day of correlation with the more mature markets. The rally kicked in well ahead of economic data out of the U.S, however. Weak U.S stats continued to support the FED’s projected rate cut later in the day year. While the cheaper cost of funds is a boon for riskier assets, the current interest rate environment continues to be supportive. A negative for Bitcoin and the broader market continues to be the prospect of a material shift in the regulatory landscape. There’s also the pending SEC decisions on the Bitcoin ETFs to consider. The recent volatility across the broader market has come at the wrong time for those hoping for Bitcoin ETFs to be approved. The good news, however, is the fact that there have been no headline cases of exchanges being hacked… Another piece of good news is the fact that the planned launch of Facebook’s Libra has done no damage just yet… At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.63% to $11,787. In the early part of the day, Bitcoin rose to a start of a day high $12,065 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,379.33, Bitcoin fell back to a late morning low $11,503. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33, Bitcoin moved back through to $11,700 levels. For the Bitcoin bulls, $12,000 looks to be the line in the sand. A hold onto $11,700 levels through the early afternoon would support a move back through to $11,900 levels. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $12,065. In the event of a breakout, the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 would come into play before any pullback. Failure to hold onto $11,700 levels could see Bitcoin slide back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Barring an extended sell-off through the afternoon, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit the downside. In the event of a sell-off, expect a return to sub-$11,000 levels before finding support.

Non-custodial crypto wallet ZenGo adding support for Facebook’s Libra coin," ZenGo, a provider of non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, is adding support for Facebook's upcoming cryptocurrency Libra, according to an announcement Tuesday. The firm has released a proof-of-concept for Libra testnet, using a cryptographic technique called threshold signatures scheme (TSS), which helps create a secure and easy-to-use transaction process. ""TSS removes the burden of the single atomic private key and splits the responsibility between multiple parties. Each of the parties generates its own secret and uses this secret to distributively sign a transaction without revealing the secret to the other parties,"" ZenGo explained. Facebook's crypto subsidiary, Calibra, will be launching a default custodial wallet for storing Libra, but that could hinder mass adoption of the cryptocurrency because users would have to trust Calibra to store their coins, ZenGo CEO, Ouriel Ohayon, told The Block. ""True ownership comes with non-custodial options which Libra seems to encourage too. The challenge is to get a large number of users unfamiliar with security, key management and complex backup process to cross that path. It's great to see that developers can build true non-custodial Calibra alternatives where users control their funds,"" Ohayon added. ZenGo wallet currently supports bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) cryptocurrencies. It is currently also preparing to add support for Binance's BNB, Zilliqa's ZIL and Tezos' XTZ tokens, with more cryptocurrencies planned for the future, per the announcement. ZenGo recently raised $4 million from investors including Samsung and Benson Oak Ventures, aiming to simplify the process of storing and managing cryptocurrencies for common men."

Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto," In a recent interview on London Real, the Bitcoin and open blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos talked about the wrong type of people entering the digital asset economy, and why many end up staying for different reasons other than price. On the topic of the many hype-based cryptocurrency projects we see today, Antonopoulos said that the industry sometimes attracts the wrong type of crowd into the ecosystem. “It attracts scammers, opportunists, pump and dumpers, and pyramid schemes, and the ICO market enabled a lot of those people to make their own coins.” Andreas said that one of the reasons the ICO craze happened was because Ethereum made it easy for people to build a scalable, secure, transferable, and censorship-resistant blockchain “just by writing 20 lines of code”. But the Mastering Ethereum author said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains “to build platforms to do massive pump and dumps” instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance. However, he did mention that in the long run, “if you can fund start-ups with an international pool of investors, that can change the investment fields”. FOMO is in the air. Newbies are joining the cryptocurrency space and falling prey to scammers.  Please educate your friends and family:– Promises of profit are 100% ponzi– Request to ""recruit"", ""affiliate"" etc are 100% pyramid schemes– ICO/IEO are 99.99% pump-and-dump — Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) June 20, 2019  Regarding the parabolic rises and falls of many crypto assets, Andreas said that “nothing goes exponential without going down”, and that Bitcoin has done this eight times already as “that’s how it grows”. “The reason it grows like this is that there isn’t much in terms of short pressure to hold it down,” he said. “If you’ve got something that has limited supply and you suddenly have a speculative mania that blows up, it will continue to go up in a straight line, which only further fuels the mania. “Until it reaches a point where there simply isn’t anybody else who feels just as enthusiastic and it pauses for a second, the panic just drives [the price] down.” Andreas said that there’s “no difference between speculators and investors” and that they’re just speculating with a different risk profile, with some of them doing so “with very little research and information”. He said that the reason this is bad is that “a lot of good, innocent, and slightly naive people lost a lot of money” and had their lives destroyed because of this. This has a negative effect “as it changes the community” and “causes damage to the community”. “You have a lot of drama that comes up when there’s money on the table – people’s personalities change.” He said that people start taking shortcuts and their ethics become compromised – “power corrupts, money corrupts”. Andreas said that the majority of people first got involved in crypto most likely “because they heard that it’s some kind of investment opportunity”. He made the case that even though many of these people may have first entered the space “because of speculation and mania”, the people who were only motivated by price left during the 2018 crash, with those who stayed “finding other motivations”. He claimed some of the reasons why people stay is because they like the community, they understand the technology, and they may even be “driven by the political implications”. To those people, Andreas said: “Welcome, you may have come because you want to get rich – that’s okay. Now let me tell you about why you should stay because of the technology even after the price crashes.”   The post Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto appeared first on Coin Rivet."
Ethereum Analysis – Support Levels in Play – 03/07/19," It’s been a bearish first half of the week. Following last week’s 2.76% gain, Ethereum was down by 8.13%, Sunday through Tuesday. A bearish start to the week saw Ethereum slide by 8.51% on Sunday to set the tone early on. In spite of finding support on Monday to hold on to $290 levels, with a 1.25% gain, the reversal continued on Tuesday. Ethereum fell by a further 0.84% to end the day at $291.25. Falling from a current week high $323.61 from Sunday, Ethereum fell to a current week low $270.42 on Tuesday. Steering well clear of the first major resistance level at $363.16, Ethereum fell through the first major support level at $272.17 before recovering to $291 levels. While falling back from the 38.2% FIB of $367, Ethereum managed to steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $257. The extended bearish trend, formed at last May 2018’s swing hi $828.97, remained firmly intact, however. Ethereum continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $367, following December’s swing lo $80.6. For the bulls, a breakout from the 38.2% FIB of $367 would be needed to form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 0.67% to $293.19. A move back through to $320 levels would signal a 2nd half of a week rebound. Ethereum would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $300. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, a move through to $320 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $363.16 into play. Barring a crypto rally going into the weekend, however, the first major resistance level and the 38.2% FIB would cap any upside in the event of a bounce back. With volatility returning to the broader market, a break through the 38.2% FIB would bring $400 levels into view. Failure to move through to $320 levels would likely leave Ethereum on the back foot through the week. A fall through the current week low $270.42 could see Ethereum slide through the 23.6% FIB of $257 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ethereum should steer well clear of the second major support level at $227.34. A visit to $260 levels would be on the cards, however, in the event of a sell-off. Major Support Level: $272.17 Major Resistance Level: $363.16 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $257 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $367 62% FIB Retracement Level: $543 This article was originally posted on FX Empire"
The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 05/07/19," Bitcoin led the way on Thursday, but this time for all the wrong reasons… Bitcoin tumbled by 6.85% on Thursday.

The moves through the morning saw Bitcoin leave the major support and resistance levels untested. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin recovered to an afternoon high $11,922 before taking a hit in the final hour. The final hour sell-off saw Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33. For Bitcoin, the only positive of the day was the avoidance of sub-$11,000 levels for the first time since 29th June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was red for all but one of the top 10 cryptos on Thursday. Bucking the trend on the day was Binance Coin, which rose by 1.23%. It was deep red for the rest of the pack. Ethereum was close behind Bitcoin, sliding by 6.29%, with EOS (-5.62%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-5%) also seeing heavy losses. Things were not much better for Ripple’s XRP and Tron, which fell by 4.47% and 4.7% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin saw more modest losses on the day. While Bitcoin Cash SV fell by 3.44%, Litecoin fell by just 1.8%. The Bitcoin sell-off on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance pulling back to 62% levels.

Whilst leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 before the pullback. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.71%), EOS (+0.23%) and Ethereum (+0.25%) also found early support. Litecoin and Binance Coin struggled at the start, with losses of 0.56% and 0.6% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to $11,430 levels to support a reversal of Thursday’s losses. A move through to $11,500 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,800 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $11,287. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could touch $12,000 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,430 levels could see Bitcoin take another hit. A fall through the morning low $11,005 would bring the first major support level at $10,790 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $10,417.5 on the day.

Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date?," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook’s first foray into cryptocurrency is coming – first dubbed ‘Facebook Coin’, then ‘Global Coin’, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It’s at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle – the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don’t have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: “The Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.” So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it’s a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn’t allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves. Is there a darker side to Libra? The post Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date? appeared first on Coin Rivet."

Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date?," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook’s first foray into cryptocurrency is coming – first dubbed ‘Facebook Coin’, then ‘Global Coin’, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It’s at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle – the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don’t have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: “The Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.” So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it’s a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn’t allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves. Is there a darker side to Libra? The post Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date? appeared first on Coin Rivet."
Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of “digital payment tokens” in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, “will not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.” The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: “(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.”  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. “A digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,” it said."
Ethereum Analysis – Support Levels in Play – 03/07/19," It’s been a bearish first half of the week. Following last week’s 2.76% gain, Ethereum was down by 8.13%, Sunday through Tuesday. A bearish start to the week saw Ethereum slide by 8.51% on Sunday to set the tone early on. In spite of finding support on Monday to hold on to $290 levels, with a 1.25% gain, the reversal continued on Tuesday. Ethereum fell by a further 0.84% to end the day at $291.25. Falling from a current week high $323.61 from Sunday, Ethereum fell to a current week low $270.42 on Tuesday. Steering well clear of the first major resistance level at $363.16, Ethereum fell through the first major support level at $272.17 before recovering to $291 levels. While falling back from the 38.2% FIB of $367, Ethereum managed to steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $257. The extended bearish trend, formed at last May 2018’s swing hi $828.97, remained firmly intact, however. Ethereum continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $367, following December’s swing lo $80.6. For the bulls, a breakout from the 38.2% FIB of $367 would be needed to form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 0.67% to $293.19. A move back through to $320 levels would signal a 2nd half of a week rebound. Ethereum would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $300. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, a move through to $320 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $363.16 into play. Barring a crypto rally going into the weekend, however, the first major resistance level and the 38.2% FIB would cap any upside in the event of a bounce back. With volatility returning to the broader market, a break through the 38.2% FIB would bring $400 levels into view. Failure to move through to $320 levels would likely leave Ethereum on the back foot through the week. A fall through the current week low $270.42 could see Ethereum slide through the 23.6% FIB of $257 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ethereum should steer well clear of the second major support level at $227.34. A visit to $260 levels would be on the cards, however, in the event of a sell-off. Major Support Level: $272.17 Major Resistance Level: $363.16 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $257 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $367 62% FIB Retracement Level: $543 This article was originally posted on FX Empire"

In August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are. The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without “relying on trust”. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number “0” (or the “genesis block”) which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) developed by the Ripple company. It is also referred to as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol. It can trace its roots to 2004 when a web developer called Ryan Fugger had the idea to create a monetary system that was decentralised and could effectively allow individuals to create their own money. Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on 30th July 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a white paper in 2013 describing Ethereum. Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn’t get buy-in to his proposal. Bitcoin Cash was born out of the idea of making Bitcoin more practical for small, day-to-day payments. In May 2017, Bitcoin payments took about four days unless a fee was paid, which was proportionately too large for small transactions. A change to the code was implemented and Bitcoin Cash was born on 1st August 2017. Litecoin was released in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee. It was a fork of Bitcoin with the main difference being a smaller block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, and a different script-based algorithm.

With Bitcoin bucking the trend to see green on the day, Bitcoin’s dominance moved back to 61% levels. The total crypto market cap recovered from sub-$290 levels on Tuesday to end the day at $313.2bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 2.73% to $11,182 as the bulls look to restore order. Moves within the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a low $10,876 to a high $11,200 before easing back. While leaving the major support and resistance levels untested early on, Bitcoin came within range of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day for the majors. Ethereum tracked Bitcoin early on, with a 1.01% gain. Tron (+0.94%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.03%), and Litecoin (+1.18%) also made solid gains. Bucking the trend in the early hours, however, was Binance Coin with a 0.31% loss. Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to bring the first major resistance level at $11,323.93 into play. Having failed to touch $11,000 levels on Tuesday, the early move should support a bullish day ahead. An early break through the first major resistance level would bring $11,500 levels into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall back through to $10,500 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,087.13 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,000 support levels on the day. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today This article was originally posted on FX Empire"

Bitcoin rallied by 10.09% on Wednesday. Following on from a 2.29% gain from Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,982. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major resistance level at $11,323.93 before hitting reverse. Bitcoin fell back through the 23.6% FIB to sub-$11,000 levels before bouncing back to $11,500 levels. A relatively choppy afternoon saw Bitcoin find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 before a late in the day rally. The late rally saw Bitcoin rise from an afternoon low $11,038 to a late intraday high $12,025. Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB, first major resistance level at $11,323.93 and second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of green across the crypto-board. Coming in a distant second to Bitcoin was Ethereum, which gained 3.62%. Bitcoin Cash SV (+3.03%), Litecoin (+2.69%), EOS (+2.39%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.25%), Tron (+2.14%) and Binance Coin (+2.10%) also made solid gains on the day. For Stellar’s Lumen, a modest 1.52% gain on the day saw the gap widen with Tron sitting at the number 10 spot by market cap. The Bitcoin rally on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance rising back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 63.1% The total crypto market cap rose from $315bn levels to $337.4bn on Wednesday, supported by Bitcoin’s break out.

Amongst the cryptos in reverse, Bitcoin Cash SV saw the most modest loss, down by 0.02% at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,800 levels through the morning to support a rebound later in the day. A move through the morning high $12,065 would bring the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high. Failure to hold onto $11,800 levels could see Bitcoin cough up Wednesday’s gains. A fall through to sub-$11,630 levels would bring the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit any downside in the event of an extended sell-off.

"Bitcoin may soon go parabolic over $12,000 again"," Bitcoin is once more looking bullish as the world’s biggest decentralised asset has found a new influx of buying support to rally close to 20% in price since the start of July. On a backdrop of global turmoils driven by a narrative of trade tensions, a breakout in the gold and commodities markets, and even US President Donald Trump calling out China and Europe specifically for currency manipulation, could this be the perfect storm for Bitcoin to break past resistance and head upwards to fresh 2019 highs? China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for many years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019  Long-time Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos has reminded the community that governments may soon try and “blame crypto for the currency war”, but “the race to the bottom” for state-backed fiat currencies has little to do with the disruptive asset class. Towards the end of last week, Bitcoin continued to grind to defend its five-figure valuation. Unlike other downward price movements that we have seen of late, Bitcoin’s move down did not include any large-scale sell-offs, but instead a series of mini-dumps taking the price down from $12,000 to $10,000. Since this local bottom was hit, we have seen volumes pick up and buyers come back into the market to drive the price back up to the same level where the ‘controlled’ sell-off began. If Bitcoin can now penetrate through the $12,000-$12,400 level of resistance, the move back up to $14,000 and beyond may be quicker than its initial parabolic rise in late June. If the digitally-scarce asset does decide to rally up from this point, the odds of ever seeing an exchange-traded price of under $10,000 will decrease exponentially as fast as any potential move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency. That is why we are all here.  Anything short of this becomes much less interesting. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 4, 2019    The popular Bitcoin analyst Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano recently outlined his $100,000 Bitcoin target for the end of 2021, but the chances are that if we do see all-time highs broken sooner rather than later, a six-figure valuation for Bitcoin may become a reality quicker than even the most bullish commentators in the space would ever expect.

Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto," In a recent interview on London Real, the Bitcoin and open blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos talked about the wrong type of people entering the digital asset economy, and why many end up staying for different reasons other than price. On the topic of the many hype-based cryptocurrency projects we see today, Antonopoulos said that the industry sometimes attracts the wrong type of crowd into the ecosystem. “It attracts scammers, opportunists, pump and dumpers, and pyramid schemes, and the ICO market enabled a lot of those people to make their own coins.” Andreas said that one of the reasons the ICO craze happened was because Ethereum made it easy for people to build a scalable, secure, transferable, and censorship-resistant blockchain “just by writing 20 lines of code”. But the Mastering Ethereum author said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains “to build platforms to do massive pump and dumps” instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance. However, he did mention that in the long run, “if you can fund start-ups with an international pool of investors, that can change the investment fields”. FOMO is in the air. Newbies are joining the cryptocurrency space and falling prey to scammers.  Please educate your friends and family:– Promises of profit are 100% ponzi– Request to ""recruit"", ""affiliate"" etc are 100% pyramid schemes– ICO/IEO are 99.99% pump-and-dump — Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) June 20, 2019  Regarding the parabolic rises and falls of many crypto assets, Andreas said that “nothing goes exponential without going down”, and that Bitcoin has done this eight times already as “that’s how it grows”. “The reason it grows like this is that there isn’t much in terms of short pressure to hold it down,” he said. “If you’ve got something that has limited supply and you suddenly have a speculative mania that blows up, it will continue to go up in a straight line, which only further fuels the mania. “Until it reaches a point where there simply isn’t anybody else who feels just as enthusiastic and it pauses for a second, the panic just drives [the price] down.” Andreas said that there’s “no difference between speculators and investors” and that they’re just speculating with a different risk profile, with some of them doing so “with very little research and information”. He said that the reason this is bad is that “a lot of good, innocent, and slightly naive people lost a lot of money” and had their lives destroyed because of this. This has a negative effect “as it changes the community” and “causes damage to the community”. “You have a lot of drama that comes up when there’s money on the table – people’s personalities change.” He said that people start taking shortcuts and their ethics become compromised – “power corrupts, money corrupts”. Andreas said that the majority of people first got involved in crypto most likely “because they heard that it’s some kind of investment opportunity”. He made the case that even though many of these people may have first entered the space “because of speculation and mania”, the people who were only motivated by price left during the 2018 crash, with those who stayed “finding other motivations”. He claimed some of the reasons why people stay is because they like the community, they understand the technology, and they may even be “driven by the political implications”. To those people, Andreas said: “Welcome, you may have come because you want to get rich – that’s okay. Now let me tell you about why you should stay because of the technology even after the price crashes.”   The post Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto appeared first on Coin Rivet."
The Crypto Week – Bitcoin Leads the Way in a Mixed Week for the Majors," While the Bitcoin bulls continued to maintain control, its been another mixed week for the rest of the pack. Bitcoin rose by 2.56% on Saturday. Reversing a 1.42% fall from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,281. On the day, a bullish start to the morning saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,961 to a morning high $11,594 before easing back. The early rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major resistance level at $11,378. Following a relatively range-bound late morning, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $11,720. Falling short of the second major resistance level at $11,753, slid back through the 23.6% FIB to a 2nd half of a day low $11,066. For the bulls, steering clear of sub-$11,000 levels was key late in the day, supporting a move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,280 levels. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 4.45%, which was also supported by 2.29% and 10.09% gains from Tuesday and Wednesday respectively.

Another choppy week saw the total crypto market cap recover from a Tuesday current week low $288.64bn to a current week high $337.76bn. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $320.33bn. 24-hour trading volumes were on the slide, however.

Elsewhere, Litecoin recovered from early losses to move into the green, up by 0.06% at the time of writing. Joining Litecoin in the green were EOS (+0.54%), Ethereum (+0.18%) and Binance Coin (+0.02%). Bitcoin Cash ABC joined Bitcoin in the red with a -1.64%, while Bitcoin Cash SV was flat. Bitcoin would need to break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 to $11,320 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $11,680.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $11,720 would likely limit any upside. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,320 levels could see Bitcoin slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $11,111 would bring the first major support level at $10,921.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,900 levels on the day. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today This article was originally posted on FX Empire"

Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date?," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook’s first foray into cryptocurrency is coming – first dubbed ‘Facebook Coin’, then ‘Global Coin’, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It’s at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle – the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don’t have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: “The Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.” So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it’s a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn’t allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves. Is there a darker side to Libra? The post Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date? appeared first on Coin Rivet."
Non-custodial crypto wallet ZenGo adding support for Facebook’s Libra coin," ZenGo, a provider of non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, is adding support for Facebook's upcoming cryptocurrency Libra, according to an announcement Tuesday. The firm has released a proof-of-concept for Libra testnet, using a cryptographic technique called threshold signatures scheme (TSS), which helps create a secure and easy-to-use transaction process. ""TSS removes the burden of the single atomic private key and splits the responsibility between multiple parties. Each of the parties generates its own secret and uses this secret to distributively sign a transaction without revealing the secret to the other parties,"" ZenGo explained. Facebook's crypto subsidiary, Calibra, will be launching a default custodial wallet for storing Libra, but that could hinder mass adoption of the cryptocurrency because users would have to trust Calibra to store their coins, ZenGo CEO, Ouriel Ohayon, told The Block. ""True ownership comes with non-custodial options which Libra seems to encourage too. The challenge is to get a large number of users unfamiliar with security, key management and complex backup process to cross that path. It's great to see that developers can build true non-custodial Calibra alternatives where users control their funds,"" Ohayon added. ZenGo wallet currently supports bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) cryptocurrencies. It is currently also preparing to add support for Binance's BNB, Zilliqa's ZIL and Tezos' XTZ tokens, with more cryptocurrencies planned for the future, per the announcement. ZenGo recently raised $4 million from investors including Samsung and Benson Oak Ventures, aiming to simplify the process of storing and managing cryptocurrencies for common men."
"KuCoin launches derivatives trading platform KuMEX, promises up to 20x leverage"," Count this as the latest attempt by a cryptocurrency exchange to take a piece of the perpetual swap pie. IDG-backed KuCoin has announced the beta launch of its derivatives trading platform, KuMEX. To start, the new platform will offer trading of its so-called Bitcoin Perpetual Contract (XBTUSDM).  KuCoin is the latest cryptocurrency exchange to announce its intention to gatecrash the market for cryptocurrency derivatives, a space currently dominated by behemoth BitMEX. Houbi, Binance, and Bitfinex have recently launched or announced the impending launch of their own platforms to trade perpetual swaps, a synthetic way to bet on cryptocurrencies.  As part of its attempt to lure traders to the new venue, KuMEX will offer rebates to certain traders. “At the same time, KuMEX offers a negative fee for Makers at a rate of -0.025% with a certain amount of fixed commission, encouraging users to provide liquidity to the platform through making the market and earning some commission as an incentive,” the press release reads. Furthermore, the platform uses Bitcoin Spot Index that volume-weights the price of bitcoin in six major exchanges—Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, Liquid and Bittrex. According to the press release, by using figures from more exchanges, KuMEX hopes to achieve a more “fair and rigorous” bitcoin index price. Meanwhile, rival BitMEX prices its swaps based on data from a pool of three exchanges.  KuCoin also announced a trading competition, with a reward of 10,000 KCS for users with top scores in their return rate ranking."
Making this easy to understand isn’t easy," Having recently read an article on the BBC website purporting to try and explain the importance of blockchain to the world’s economy, I was struck by the intellectual muddiness of these waters and how easy it is to confuse blockchain with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with altcoins. It really is no wonder that the “man on the street” doesn’t understand these things, and consequently these misconceptions have become a real barrier to mainstream adoption. At the heart of blockchain, it really isn’t much more than a ledger or database (dependent on which descriptor you prefer). A blockchain database is unique, however, through its three pillars of being distributed (multiple copies of), being decentralised (no one copy has version control), and immutable (each transaction recorded is unchangeable). Bitcoin was the first blockchain, and as such is frequently referred to when trying to explain or understand blockchain. What the Bitcoin protocol (the underlying rules of the blockchain) solved technically was the double spend problem. This was key to creating a digital cash that was unforgeable. It’s easy to go too far down the rabbit hole on Bitcoin and start looking at the economic programming and proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors, but this takes us away from understanding blockchain. In order to offer a simple explanation of the difference between blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it’s best to use the analogy of the internet and email. Email, it’s widely agreed, was the internet’s first killer app – so email is simply an application built on top of the internet, but the internet offers far more than just email. Similarly, Bitcoin was blockchain’s first killer app, and as such, all cryptocurrency is built on top of a blockchain – but blockchain can do so much more than just cryptocurrency. With blockchain working as a shared ledger and acting as a trusted central source of truth, we can see organisations looking to solve such complex topics as digital identity (Sovrin), supply chain digital transformation (Tradelens), food provenance (IBM Food Trust), and efficiency in the transportation and logistic industry (BITA). Under the cloak of darkness, many companies are aiming to create proof of concepts that can deliver real-world results for their various industries. In time, the cloak will be lifted and we will see which ones have succeeded and, hopefully, which ones have failed and we can learn from. The Bitcoin protocol is slow, but this is not the protocol that would be used in enterprise environments. The Bitcoin protocol is energy hungry (through PoW), but enterprise blockchains would not use PoW as its consensus mechanism. If you’re looking at having a digital form of money, it makes sense that there should be a cost to creating it in the form of energy consumption. If you’re aiming to clean up the luxury goods markets from fakes and rip-offs, a consortia of luxury goods manufacturers and retailers using proof of authority makes sense – it really is a case of horses for courses. The article also discusses the value that many intermediaries have, and this isn’t wrong. There are plenty of middlemen that actually add value to our every day lives, including the basic function of banking to be the trusted custodian of our money. However, there are also plenty of things that commercial banks do that do not add value, and we should take back sovereignty over – international transfers of money for one. Centralised third-party middlemen are not the problem, the degree to which we can trust them to act on our behalf is. The BBC article misunderstands a basic precept about Bitcoin regarding the speed of transactions by comparing it to Mastercard and Visa. A better comparison for Bitcoin is gold, where transaction in the metal takes a long time and costs a lot of money as it’s generally done as a settlement layer at central bank level. One day in the future, I, and many others believe that Bitcoin will be able to be used as simply as Mastercard or Visa is today, but that requires a layer two solution (such as Lightning), and a much more significant market cap that would be in the trillions of dollars. We may be some way from that being a reality at the present time, but that is just a reason why we should make the effort to understand these issues today. The article jumps to talking about problems with other blockchain based currencies, known as altcoins, but without creating a clear distinction from Bitcoin and creating the clarification that there is no “the blockchain”, but actually many different flavours of the same concept. Many of the altcoins, are based upon a token that drives actions on top of the matching blockchain. For example, Ethereum was a new protocol that went live in 2015 and was intended to be a decentralised global computer with the ability to execute smart contracts. Ether was the token created both as a way to raise the initial funds to build the technology and is now the gas that powers it. Ethereum also paved the way for a glut of new tokens created by entrepreneurs (and scammers) on top of the Ethereum protocol, most of which only had a utility within the application built on top of it. Many people have tried to create new cryptocurrencies, some through forks of pre-existing protocols and coins (such as Bitcoin), and some as entirely new protocols. For some of the entrepreneurs that went down this road, it was little more than a way of making themselves rich. However the main problem with the altcoins when trying to be viewed as money, is that they tend to be overly centralised (meaning that the transactions and rules of the currency won’t have as much trust), and look to reduce energy consumption and speed up transaction throughput through different consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated PoS, and tend to lack scarcity – if you understand economics, it’s fairly easy to see that without significant cost and scarcity, there can be no significant value created with respect to money. Again, look at the comparison to finding and excavating gold from the earth. My belief is that in ten years’ time, Bitcoin will have either changed the world we live in or will have become virtually valueless. Conversely, I believe that blockchain is here to stay and will change the world but needs to fade into the background. The reality is that blockchain is still mostly hype, as was the internet in 1994. The industry needs time to develop – just because it’s hype today, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t real world-changing tech there.

Coinsquare buys majority stake in Just Cash in bid to make world’s ATMs crypto-friendly," Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinsquare is making a bid to make digital assets more accessible.  Coinsquare has announced it has made a controlling investment in software provider Just Cash, whose tech will allow any ATM to sell cryptocurrency. The software does not disrupt the ATM network, no hardware changes are required and there are no additional costs to the operator. Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond believes crypto-friendly ATMs are key to making digital assets accessible to the masses.  “Right now, there is a lack of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption because most people are intimidated by the process to acquire it,” said Diamond. “By using the millions of existing ATMs around the world, we can now bridge the gap and give new users the easiest and most familiar experience to purchase cryptocurrency.”"
"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 06/07/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC rose by 0.46% on Friday. Partially reversing a 5% slide from Thursday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $400.0. A choppy day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC slide to a mid-morning intraday low $393.06 before finding support. Steering clear of the first major support level at $390.63, Bitcoin Cash ABC rallied to a late morning intraday high $411.50. In spite of the upswing, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell short of the first major resistance level at $413.25 and 23.6% FIB of $418. Easing back through the afternoon, Bitcoin Cash ABC slid back to $396 levels before a late recovery to $400 levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 1.13% to $404.5. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $400.67 to a high $404.5. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold above $401.5 would support a run at the first major resistance level at $409.98. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the continued support of the broader market, however, to take a run on Thursday’s high $411.5. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin Cash ABC would likely fall short of recovery through the 23.6% FIB of $418.0. Failure to hold above $401.5 could see Bitcoin Cash ABC test the first major support level at $391.54. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$390 support levels on the day. Litecoin fell by 0.79% on Friday. Following on from a 1.8% fall from Thursday, Litecoin ended the day at $118.54. A choppy morning saw Litecoin fall to a low $116.88 before striking a late morning intraday high $120.85. The early pullback saw Litecoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $117 to come within range of the first major support level at $116.62. In spite of rebound, Litecoin fell short of the first major resistance level at $124.96. Pulling back through the afternoon, Litecoin fell back through the 23.6% FIB to an intraday low $116.56. Litecoin tested the first major support level at $116.62 for a 2nd time on the day before a recovering to $119 levels. A late pullback saw Litecoin fall back into the red for the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up 1.28% to $120.06. Tracking the broader market, Litecoin rose from a morning low $118.41 to a high $120.79 before easing back. Steering clear of the major support levels, the first major resistance level at $120.74 pinned Litecoin back early on. For the day ahead, a hold above $118 levels would support another move through the first major resistance level at $120.74. Litecoin would need support from the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $122.94. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Thursday’s high $120.85 and the first major resistance level would likely limit any upside. Failure to hold above $118 levels could see Litecoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $117. The first major support level at $116.45 would likely limit any downside. Ripple’s XRP fell by 2.15% on Friday. Following on from a 4.47% slide from Thursday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.37948. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP slide from an intraday high $0.38920 to a mid-morning intraday low $0.37405. The reversal saw Ripple’s XRP fall through the first major support level at $0.3802. Ripple’s XRP managed to recover to $0.385 levels by late morning before easing back through the 2nd half of the day to sub-$0.38 levels. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 1.34% to $0.38457. A bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rise from a morning low $0.37936 to a high $0.38612 before easing back. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold above $0.3810 levels would support further upside on the day. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to break through the first major resistance level at $0.3878. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Thursday’s high $0.3892 and first major resistance level would likely cap any upside. Failure to hold above $0.3810 levels could see Ripple’s XRP test the first major support level at $0.3726 before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Ripple’s XRP will likely steer clear of sub-$0.37 levels on the day.

Casa rolls out cryptocurrency mobile app to attract bitcoin novices," Cryptocurrency custody startup Casa has rolled out a new mobile app.  Sats App is a noncustodial wallet that allows users to manage their lightning nodes straight from their mobile phone, CoinDesk writes. Casa is planning to add a rewards program to attract more cryptocurrency early adopters, who can earn cryptocurrency and learn about cryptocurrencies and node management. “Features are focused on increasing adoption of bitcoin and lightning nodes,” said Casa CEO Jeremy Welch. “You will be able to earn bitcoin if you don’t have a Casa node, but you will be able to earn bitcoin faster if you have a node.” The app will currently be available only to Casa customers, with a full roll-out planned for later this month. According to Welch, although the app is “lightweight,” it offers multiple actions — earning sats and operating a full node. “It’s private, secure and connects over Tor,” he added. Earlier this year, Casa announced a “core shift” to its business, launching the Keymaster mobile app and plug-and-play Bitcoin Lightning node Casa Node. "
"SEC seeks blockchain data provider to monitor risk, improve compliance, and inform policy"," The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is getting ever more serious about blockchain data. While many of the world's governments and politicians focus on Facebook's recently introduced Libra and data sharing among virtual asset providers, the SEC is seeking more data on public blockchains. The requirements listed by the SEC specific that all data is sourced from hosted notes rather than blockchain explorers. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are mandatory, while Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Zcash, EOS, NEO and XRP data are all specified as desirable. In addition, as new blockchains gain increased prominence, the SEC would require support for them. The SEC is seeking full blockchain data from the genesis block or inception and information about any derivative currencies (tokens) affiliated with these blockchains. The required data format is very specific with normalized fields for each included blockchain sourced from on-node data, in its entirety. The minimum fields specified are ticker symbol; send and receive addresses; transaction hash, timestamp and amounts; unspent send and receive balances; transaction fees; confirmations; block hash; and block height. If possible, the SEC also seeks further metadata and chain metrics such as hashing algorithms, hashing power, mining difficulty and rewards, transactions quantity and size, coin supply and blockchain size. The data is expected to be provided directly by the vendor's own node for each blockchain using a secure, encrypted data feed; synced with the network; and run in a secure, controlled environment. The data must also be presented with means to validate its accuracy and completeness and meet the requirements of financial statement audit testing. The contract length will be for one year, followed by four optional 12 month terms. A technical quote and price quote are both required for application. The SEC's deadline for submission by prospective data vendors is 12pm EST on July 11, 2019. "
Bitcoin Tech Analysis – Recap and Mid-Day Review – 04/07/19," Bitcoin rallied by 10.09% on Wednesday. Following on from a 2.29% gain on Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,983. A bullish start to the day set the tone, with Bitcoin on the move from the start of the day. Bitcoin rallied from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. The moves through the early hours saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and the first major resistance level at $11,762.87. A pullback to sub-$11,000 levels by late morning saw Bitcoin steer clear of the first major support level at $10,087.13 before a late rally. The late rally saw Bitcoin break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275, first major resistance level at $11,323.93, and second major resistance level at $11,762.87 to hit an intraday high $12,025. Resistance at $12,000 limited the upside on the day. The Bitcoin rally led to Bitcoin’s dominance rising back to 62% levels. Bitcoin’s market cap jumped to a Wednesday high $213.5bn before easing back. Bitcoin ultimately provided support to the broader crypto market, leading the majors into positive territory on the day. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December’s swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin continued to find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Wednesday’s rally was another day of correlation with the more mature markets. The rally kicked in well ahead of economic data out of the U.S, however. Weak U.S stats continued to support the FED’s projected rate cut later in the day year. While the cheaper cost of funds is a boon for riskier assets, the current interest rate environment continues to be supportive. A negative for Bitcoin and the broader market continues to be the prospect of a material shift in the regulatory landscape. There’s also the pending SEC decisions on the Bitcoin ETFs to consider. The recent volatility across the broader market has come at the wrong time for those hoping for Bitcoin ETFs to be approved. The good news, however, is the fact that there have been no headline cases of exchanges being hacked… Another piece of good news is the fact that the planned launch of Facebook’s Libra has done no damage just yet… At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.63% to $11,787. In the early part of the day, Bitcoin rose to a start of a day high $12,065 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,379.33, Bitcoin fell back to a late morning low $11,503. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33, Bitcoin moved back through to $11,700 levels. For the Bitcoin bulls, $12,000 looks to be the line in the sand. A hold onto $11,700 levels through the early afternoon would support a move back through to $11,900 levels. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $12,065. In the event of a breakout, the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 would come into play before any pullback. Failure to hold onto $11,700 levels could see Bitcoin slide back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Barring an extended sell-off through the afternoon, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit the downside. In the event of a sell-off, expect a return to sub-$11,000 levels before finding support.

Litecoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at Thursday’s high $127.37. An early move through to $125 levels would bring the second major resistance level at $130.34 into play. Failure to move through to $122 levels could see Litecoin fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $118.5 would bring the 23.6% FIB of $117 into play before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Litecoin should steer clear of the first major support level at $116.62. Ripple’s XRP slid by 4.47% on Thursday.

Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, for a break out from $0.3950 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP will likely come up short of $0.40 levels on the day. Failure to move through to $0.3935 levels could see Ripple’s XRP fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $0.3844 would bring the first major support level at $0.3802 into play.

Ethereum Analysis – Support Levels in Play – 03/07/19," It’s been a bearish first half of the week. Following last week’s 2.76% gain, Ethereum was down by 8.13%, Sunday through Tuesday. A bearish start to the week saw Ethereum slide by 8.51% on Sunday to set the tone early on. In spite of finding support on Monday to hold on to $290 levels, with a 1.25% gain, the reversal continued on Tuesday. Ethereum fell by a further 0.84% to end the day at $291.25. Falling from a current week high $323.61 from Sunday, Ethereum fell to a current week low $270.42 on Tuesday. Steering well clear of the first major resistance level at $363.16, Ethereum fell through the first major support level at $272.17 before recovering to $291 levels. While falling back from the 38.2% FIB of $367, Ethereum managed to steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $257. The extended bearish trend, formed at last May 2018’s swing hi $828.97, remained firmly intact, however. Ethereum continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $367, following December’s swing lo $80.6. For the bulls, a breakout from the 38.2% FIB of $367 would be needed to form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 0.67% to $293.19. A move back through to $320 levels would signal a 2nd half of a week rebound. Ethereum would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $300. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, a move through to $320 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $363.16 into play. Barring a crypto rally going into the weekend, however, the first major resistance level and the 38.2% FIB would cap any upside in the event of a bounce back. With volatility returning to the broader market, a break through the 38.2% FIB would bring $400 levels into view. Failure to move through to $320 levels would likely leave Ethereum on the back foot through the week. A fall through the current week low $270.42 could see Ethereum slide through the 23.6% FIB of $257 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ethereum should steer well clear of the second major support level at $227.34. A visit to $260 levels would be on the cards, however, in the event of a sell-off.

Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date?," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook’s first foray into cryptocurrency is coming – first dubbed ‘Facebook Coin’, then ‘Global Coin’, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It’s at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle – the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don’t have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: “The Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.” So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it’s a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn’t allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves. Is there a darker side to Libra? The post Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date? appeared first on Coin Rivet."
Coinsquare buys majority stake in Just Cash in bid to make world’s ATMs crypto-friendly," Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinsquare is making a bid to make digital assets more accessible.  Coinsquare has announced it has made a controlling investment in software provider Just Cash, whose tech will allow any ATM to sell cryptocurrency. The software does not disrupt the ATM network, no hardware changes are required and there are no additional costs to the operator. Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond believes crypto-friendly ATMs are key to making digital assets accessible to the masses.  “Right now, there is a lack of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption because most people are intimidated by the process to acquire it,” said Diamond. “By using the millions of existing ATMs around the world, we can now bridge the gap and give new users the easiest and most familiar experience to purchase cryptocurrency.”"
Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto," In a recent interview on London Real, the Bitcoin and open blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos talked about the wrong type of people entering the digital asset economy, and why many end up staying for different reasons other than price. On the topic of the many hype-based cryptocurrency projects we see today, Antonopoulos said that the industry sometimes attracts the wrong type of crowd into the ecosystem. “It attracts scammers, opportunists, pump and dumpers, and pyramid schemes, and the ICO market enabled a lot of those people to make their own coins.” Andreas said that one of the reasons the ICO craze happened was because Ethereum made it easy for people to build a scalable, secure, transferable, and censorship-resistant blockchain “just by writing 20 lines of code”. But the Mastering Ethereum author said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains “to build platforms to do massive pump and dumps” instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance. However, he did mention that in the long run, “if you can fund start-ups with an international pool of investors, that can change the investment fields”. FOMO is in the air. Newbies are joining the cryptocurrency space and falling prey to scammers.  Please educate your friends and family:– Promises of profit are 100% ponzi– Request to ""recruit"", ""affiliate"" etc are 100% pyramid schemes– ICO/IEO are 99.99% pump-and-dump — Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) June 20, 2019  Regarding the parabolic rises and falls of many crypto assets, Andreas said that “nothing goes exponential without going down”, and that Bitcoin has done this eight times already as “that’s how it grows”. “The reason it grows like this is that there isn’t much in terms of short pressure to hold it down,” he said. “If you’ve got something that has limited supply and you suddenly have a speculative mania that blows up, it will continue to go up in a straight line, which only further fuels the mania. “Until it reaches a point where there simply isn’t anybody else who feels just as enthusiastic and it pauses for a second, the panic just drives [the price] down.” Andreas said that there’s “no difference between speculators and investors” and that they’re just speculating with a different risk profile, with some of them doing so “with very little research and information”. He said that the reason this is bad is that “a lot of good, innocent, and slightly naive people lost a lot of money” and had their lives destroyed because of this. This has a negative effect “as it changes the community” and “causes damage to the community”. “You have a lot of drama that comes up when there’s money on the table – people’s personalities change.” He said that people start taking shortcuts and their ethics become compromised – “power corrupts, money corrupts”. Andreas said that the majority of people first got involved in crypto most likely “because they heard that it’s some kind of investment opportunity”. He made the case that even though many of these people may have first entered the space “because of speculation and mania”, the people who were only motivated by price left during the 2018 crash, with those who stayed “finding other motivations”. He claimed some of the reasons why people stay is because they like the community, they understand the technology, and they may even be “driven by the political implications”. To those people, Andreas said: “Welcome, you may have come because you want to get rich – that’s okay. Now let me tell you about why you should stay because of the technology even after the price crashes.”   The post Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto appeared first on Coin Rivet."
Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of “digital payment tokens” in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, “will not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.” The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: “(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.”  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. “A digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,” it said."
The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 03/07/19," Bitcoin continued its trend-bucking form on Tuesday to end a string of losses at the turn of the quarter. Bitcoin rose by 2.29% on Tuesday. Reversing a 1.48% fall from Monday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,885. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide from a morning high $10,719 to a late morning intraday low $9,728.2. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $10,075 to test support at the 38.2% FIB of $9,734 before bouncing back. Rallying through the afternoon, Bitcoin struck a late intraday high $10,965 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin fell well short of the first major resistance level at $11,218. It was Bitcoin’s first visit to sub-$10,000 levels since 21st June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red across the crypto-board. Leading the way down was Binance Coin, which slid by 3.65%. Also seeing heavy losses were Litecoin (-3.26%), Tron (-2.89%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (-2.59%), and EOS (-2.37%). Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash SV saw more modest losses of 0.84% and 0.48% respectively. For Stellar’s Lumen, things haven’t improved since falling out of the top ten with a 2.16% loss on the day. With Bitcoin bucking the trend to see green on the day, Bitcoin’s dominance moved back to 61% levels. The total crypto market cap recovered from sub-$290 levels on Tuesday to end the day at $313.2bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 2.73% to $11,182 as the bulls look to restore order. Moves within the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a low $10,876 to a high $11,200 before easing back. While leaving the major support and resistance levels untested early on, Bitcoin came within range of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day for the majors. Ethereum tracked Bitcoin early on, with a 1.01% gain. Tron (+0.94%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.03%), and Litecoin (+1.18%) also made solid gains. Bucking the trend in the early hours, however, was Binance Coin with a 0.31% loss. Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to bring the first major resistance level at $11,323.93 into play. Having failed to touch $11,000 levels on Tuesday, the early move should support a bullish day ahead. An early break through the first major resistance level would bring $11,500 levels into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall back through to $10,500 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,087.13 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,000 support levels on the day. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today This article was originally posted on FX Empire"

The late rally saw Bitcoin rise from an afternoon low $11,038 to a late intraday high $12,025. Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB, first major resistance level at $11,323.93 and second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of green across the crypto-board. Coming in a distant second to Bitcoin was Ethereum, which gained 3.62%. Bitcoin Cash SV (+3.03%), Litecoin (+2.69%), EOS (+2.39%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.25%), Tron (+2.14%) and Binance Coin (+2.10%) also made solid gains on the day. For Stellar’s Lumen, a modest 1.52% gain on the day saw the gap widen with Tron sitting at the number 10 spot by market cap. The Bitcoin rally on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance rising back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 63.1% The total crypto market cap rose from $315bn levels to $337.4bn on Wednesday, supported by Bitcoin’s break out. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.08% to $11,852. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to a morning high $12,065 before falling to a morning low $11,808. Bitcoin left the major resistance and support levels untested in the early hours. Elsewhere, Binance Coin bucked the trend at the time of writing, rising by 0.31%. For the rest of the pack, it was back in the red. Leading the way was EOS, which was down by 2.25%. Litecoin (-1.38%), Ethereum (-1.26%) and Tron (-1.21%) were also deep in the red in the early hours. Amongst the cryptos in reverse, Bitcoin Cash SV saw the most modest loss, down by 0.02% at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,800 levels through the morning to support a rebound later in the day. A move through the morning high $12,065 would bring the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high. Failure to hold onto $11,800 levels could see Bitcoin cough up Wednesday’s gains. A fall through to sub-$11,630 levels would bring the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit any downside in the event of an extended sell-off.

Bitcoin's previous all-time high hash rate was reached on June 29, 2019, at 68.6 million tera hashes per second."
"Bitcoin may soon go parabolic over $12,000 again"," Bitcoin is once more looking bullish as the world’s biggest decentralised asset has found a new influx of buying support to rally close to 20% in price since the start of July. On a backdrop of global turmoils driven by a narrative of trade tensions, a breakout in the gold and commodities markets, and even US President Donald Trump calling out China and Europe specifically for currency manipulation, could this be the perfect storm for Bitcoin to break past resistance and head upwards to fresh 2019 highs? China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for many years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019  Long-time Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos has reminded the community that governments may soon try and “blame crypto for the currency war”, but “the race to the bottom” for state-backed fiat currencies has little to do with the disruptive asset class. Towards the end of last week, Bitcoin continued to grind to defend its five-figure valuation. Unlike other downward price movements that we have seen of late, Bitcoin’s move down did not include any large-scale sell-offs, but instead a series of mini-dumps taking the price down from $12,000 to $10,000. Since this local bottom was hit, we have seen volumes pick up and buyers come back into the market to drive the price back up to the same level where the ‘controlled’ sell-off began. If Bitcoin can now penetrate through the $12,000-$12,400 level of resistance, the move back up to $14,000 and beyond may be quicker than its initial parabolic rise in late June. If the digitally-scarce asset does decide to rally up from this point, the odds of ever seeing an exchange-traded price of under $10,000 will decrease exponentially as fast as any potential move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency. That is why we are all here.  Anything short of this becomes much less interesting. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 4, 2019    The popular Bitcoin analyst Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano recently outlined his $100,000 Bitcoin target for the end of 2021, but the chances are that if we do see all-time highs broken sooner rather than later, a six-figure valuation for Bitcoin may become a reality quicker than even the most bullish commentators in the space would ever expect.

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 05/07/19," Bitcoin led the way on Thursday, but this time for all the wrong reasons… Bitcoin tumbled by 6.85% on Thursday. Partially reversing Wednesday’s 10.09% rally to end the day at $11,162.5. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning intraday high $12,065 to a late morning low $11,503. The moves through the morning saw Bitcoin leave the major support and resistance levels untested. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin recovered to an afternoon high $11,922 before taking a hit in the final hour. The final hour sell-off saw Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33. For Bitcoin, the only positive of the day was the avoidance of sub-$11,000 levels for the first time since 29th June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was red for all but one of the top 10 cryptos on Thursday. Bucking the trend on the day was Binance Coin, which rose by 1.23%. It was deep red for the rest of the pack. Ethereum was close behind Bitcoin, sliding by 6.29%, with EOS (-5.62%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-5%) also seeing heavy losses. Things were not much better for Ripple’s XRP and Tron, which fell by 4.47% and 4.7% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin saw more modest losses on the day. While Bitcoin Cash SV fell by 3.44%, Litecoin fell by just 1.8%. The Bitcoin sell-off on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance pulling back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.5% The total crypto market cap fell from a high $338.45bn to end the day at $319.29bn on Thursday, weighed by Bitcoin’s pullback.

Whilst leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 before the pullback. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.71%), EOS (+0.23%) and Ethereum (+0.25%) also found early support. Litecoin and Binance Coin struggled at the start, with losses of 0.56% and 0.6% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to $11,430 levels to support a reversal of Thursday’s losses. A move through to $11,500 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,800 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $11,287. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could touch $12,000 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,430 levels could see Bitcoin take another hit. A fall through the morning low $11,005 would bring the first major support level at $10,790 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $10,417.5 on the day.

A move through the morning high to $11,600 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,700 into play.

"KuCoin launches derivatives trading platform KuMEX, promises up to 20x leverage"," Count this as the latest attempt by a cryptocurrency exchange to take a piece of the perpetual swap pie. IDG-backed KuCoin has announced the beta launch of its derivatives trading platform, KuMEX. To start, the new platform will offer trading of its so-called Bitcoin Perpetual Contract (XBTUSDM).  KuCoin is the latest cryptocurrency exchange to announce its intention to gatecrash the market for cryptocurrency derivatives, a space currently dominated by behemoth BitMEX. Houbi, Binance, and Bitfinex have recently launched or announced the impending launch of their own platforms to trade perpetual swaps, a synthetic way to bet on cryptocurrencies.  As part of its attempt to lure traders to the new venue, KuMEX will offer rebates to certain traders. “At the same time, KuMEX offers a negative fee for Makers at a rate of -0.025% with a certain amount of fixed commission, encouraging users to provide liquidity to the platform through making the market and earning some commission as an incentive,” the press release reads. Furthermore, the platform uses Bitcoin Spot Index that volume-weights the price of bitcoin in six major exchanges—Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, Liquid and Bittrex. According to the press release, by using figures from more exchanges, KuMEX hopes to achieve a more “fair and rigorous” bitcoin index price. Meanwhile, rival BitMEX prices its swaps based on data from a pool of three exchanges.  KuCoin also announced a trading competition, with a reward of 10,000 KCS for users with top scores in their return rate ranking."

In August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are. The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without “relying on trust”. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number “0” (or the “genesis block”) which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) developed by the Ripple company. It is also referred to as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol. It can trace its roots to 2004 when a web developer called Ryan Fugger had the idea to create a monetary system that was decentralised and could effectively allow individuals to create their own money. Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on 30th July 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a white paper in 2013 describing Ethereum. Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn’t get buy-in to his proposal. Bitcoin Cash was born out of the idea of making Bitcoin more practical for small, day-to-day payments. In May 2017, Bitcoin payments took about four days unless a fee was paid, which was proportionately too large for small transactions. A change to the code was implemented and Bitcoin Cash was born on 1st August 2017. Litecoin was released in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee. It was a fork of Bitcoin with the main difference being a smaller block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, and a different script-based algorithm.

Bitcoin rose by 2.56% on Saturday. Reversing a 1.42% fall from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,281. On the day, a bullish start to the morning saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,961 to a morning high $11,594 before easing back.

Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $11,720 would likely limit any upside. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,320 levels could see Bitcoin slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $11,111 would bring the first major support level at $10,921.33 into play.

A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall from an early intraday high $418.87 to a late morning intraday low $383.16. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the 23.6% FIB of $418 and the first major support level at $394.38.

In spite of the partial recovery, Bitcoin Cash ABC was unable to move back through the 23.6% FIB… At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 1.1% to $412.50. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $408.41 to a high $418.0. Whilst falling short of the first major resistance level at $423.54, the 23.6% FIB of $418 continued to limit progress. For the day ahead, Bitcoin Cash ABC would need to steer clear of sub-$410 levels to support another run at the first major resistance level at $423.54. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the 23.6% FIB of $418. An extended crypto rally through the day could see Bitcoin Cash ABC test the second major resistance level at $439.06. Failure to avoid sub-$410 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC slide back through to sub-$400 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, the first major support level at $387.87 should limit any downside on the day. Litecoin slid by 3.26% on Tuesday.

Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested and also held above the 23.6% FIB of $117. For the day ahead, a hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 through the morning would support a bullish day ahead. A move back through the morning high $123.16 would bring the first major resistance level at $124.27 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Litecoin would likely see any upside capped at $126 levels on the day. Failure to hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 could see Litecoin test the first major support level at $112.06 before any recovery. Barring a crypto sell-off later in the day, Litecoin should steer clear of sub-$110 support levels on the day. Ripple’s XRP fell by 1.98% on Tuesday.

Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on and also fell short of the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164. For the day ahead, a hold onto $0.40 levels through the morning would support further gains later in the day. A move back through the morning high $0.40711 would bring the first major resistance level at $0.4131 into play. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to break through the 23.6 % FIB of $0.4164. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP would likely come up short of $0.42 levels on the day. Failure to move back through the morning high $0.40711 could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse. A fall through to sub-$0.40 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.3854 into play before any recovery.

Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of “digital payment tokens” in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, “will not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.” The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: “(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.”  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. “A digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,” it said."

An early move through to $125 levels would bring the second major resistance level at $130.34 into play. Failure to move through to $122 levels could see Litecoin fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $118.5 would bring the 23.6% FIB of $117 into play before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Litecoin should steer clear of the first major support level at $116.62. Ripple’s XRP slid by 4.47% on Thursday. Reversing a 1.33% from Wednesday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.38787. Bearish from the start of the day, Ripple’s XRP fell from an early intraday high $0.40659 to a late intraday low $0.3857. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Ripple’s XRP fell through the first major support level at $0.3984 and second major support level at $0.3914. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 0.01% to $0.38783. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from a morning high $0.3892 to a low $0.3844 before steadying. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move through to $0.3935 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $0.4011. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, for a break out from $0.3950 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP will likely come up short of $0.40 levels on the day. Failure to move through to $0.3935 levels could see Ripple’s XRP fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $0.3844 would bring the first major support level at $0.3802 into play. An extended sell-off through the day could see Ripple’s XRP fall to sub-$0.38 levels before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of the second major support level at $0.3725.

Casa rolls out cryptocurrency mobile app to attract bitcoin novices," Cryptocurrency custody startup Casa has rolled out a new mobile app.  Sats App is a noncustodial wallet that allows users to manage their lightning nodes straight from their mobile phone, CoinDesk writes. Casa is planning to add a rewards program to attract more cryptocurrency early adopters, who can earn cryptocurrency and learn about cryptocurrencies and node management. “Features are focused on increasing adoption of bitcoin and lightning nodes,” said Casa CEO Jeremy Welch. “You will be able to earn bitcoin if you don’t have a Casa node, but you will be able to earn bitcoin faster if you have a node.” The app will currently be available only to Casa customers, with a full roll-out planned for later this month. According to Welch, although the app is “lightweight,” it offers multiple actions — earning sats and operating a full node. “It’s private, secure and connects over Tor,” he added. Earlier this year, Casa announced a “core shift” to its business, launching the Keymaster mobile app and plug-and-play Bitcoin Lightning node Casa Node. "
Making this easy to understand isn’t easy," Having recently read an article on the BBC website purporting to try and explain the importance of blockchain to the world’s economy, I was struck by the intellectual muddiness of these waters and how easy it is to confuse blockchain with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with altcoins. It really is no wonder that the “man on the street” doesn’t understand these things, and consequently these misconceptions have become a real barrier to mainstream adoption. At the heart of blockchain, it really isn’t much more than a ledger or database (dependent on which descriptor you prefer). A blockchain database is unique, however, through its three pillars of being distributed (multiple copies of), being decentralised (no one copy has version control), and immutable (each transaction recorded is unchangeable). Bitcoin was the first blockchain, and as such is frequently referred to when trying to explain or understand blockchain. What the Bitcoin protocol (the underlying rules of the blockchain) solved technically was the double spend problem. This was key to creating a digital cash that was unforgeable. It’s easy to go too far down the rabbit hole on Bitcoin and start looking at the economic programming and proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors, but this takes us away from understanding blockchain. In order to offer a simple explanation of the difference between blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it’s best to use the analogy of the internet and email. Email, it’s widely agreed, was the internet’s first killer app – so email is simply an application built on top of the internet, but the internet offers far more than just email. Similarly, Bitcoin was blockchain’s first killer app, and as such, all cryptocurrency is built on top of a blockchain – but blockchain can do so much more than just cryptocurrency. With blockchain working as a shared ledger and acting as a trusted central source of truth, we can see organisations looking to solve such complex topics as digital identity (Sovrin), supply chain digital transformation (Tradelens), food provenance (IBM Food Trust), and efficiency in the transportation and logistic industry (BITA). Under the cloak of darkness, many companies are aiming to create proof of concepts that can deliver real-world results for their various industries. In time, the cloak will be lifted and we will see which ones have succeeded and, hopefully, which ones have failed and we can learn from. The Bitcoin protocol is slow, but this is not the protocol that would be used in enterprise environments. The Bitcoin protocol is energy hungry (through PoW), but enterprise blockchains would not use PoW as its consensus mechanism. If you’re looking at having a digital form of money, it makes sense that there should be a cost to creating it in the form of energy consumption. If you’re aiming to clean up the luxury goods markets from fakes and rip-offs, a consortia of luxury goods manufacturers and retailers using proof of authority makes sense – it really is a case of horses for courses. The article also discusses the value that many intermediaries have, and this isn’t wrong. There are plenty of middlemen that actually add value to our every day lives, including the basic function of banking to be the trusted custodian of our money. However, there are also plenty of things that commercial banks do that do not add value, and we should take back sovereignty over – international transfers of money for one. Centralised third-party middlemen are not the problem, the degree to which we can trust them to act on our behalf is. The BBC article misunderstands a basic precept about Bitcoin regarding the speed of transactions by comparing it to Mastercard and Visa. A better comparison for Bitcoin is gold, where transaction in the metal takes a long time and costs a lot of money as it’s generally done as a settlement layer at central bank level. One day in the future, I, and many others believe that Bitcoin will be able to be used as simply as Mastercard or Visa is today, but that requires a layer two solution (such as Lightning), and a much more significant market cap that would be in the trillions of dollars. We may be some way from that being a reality at the present time, but that is just a reason why we should make the effort to understand these issues today. The article jumps to talking about problems with other blockchain based currencies, known as altcoins, but without creating a clear distinction from Bitcoin and creating the clarification that there is no “the blockchain”, but actually many different flavours of the same concept. Many of the altcoins, are based upon a token that drives actions on top of the matching blockchain. For example, Ethereum was a new protocol that went live in 2015 and was intended to be a decentralised global computer with the ability to execute smart contracts. Ether was the token created both as a way to raise the initial funds to build the technology and is now the gas that powers it. Ethereum also paved the way for a glut of new tokens created by entrepreneurs (and scammers) on top of the Ethereum protocol, most of which only had a utility within the application built on top of it. Many people have tried to create new cryptocurrencies, some through forks of pre-existing protocols and coins (such as Bitcoin), and some as entirely new protocols. For some of the entrepreneurs that went down this road, it was little more than a way of making themselves rich. However the main problem with the altcoins when trying to be viewed as money, is that they tend to be overly centralised (meaning that the transactions and rules of the currency won’t have as much trust), and look to reduce energy consumption and speed up transaction throughput through different consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated PoS, and tend to lack scarcity – if you understand economics, it’s fairly easy to see that without significant cost and scarcity, there can be no significant value created with respect to money. Again, look at the comparison to finding and excavating gold from the earth. My belief is that in ten years’ time, Bitcoin will have either changed the world we live in or will have become virtually valueless. Conversely, I believe that blockchain is here to stay and will change the world but needs to fade into the background. The reality is that blockchain is still mostly hype, as was the internet in 1994. The industry needs time to develop – just because it’s hype today, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t real world-changing tech there.

Why the Fed should oversee Facebook’s Libra," Facebook (FB) Mark Zuckerberg’s recent announcement of ambitious plans to launch a new, global cryptocurrency called Libra has been met with understandable alarm, particularly among regulators and consumer advocates. Much of the controversy has centered around antitrust issues, consumer privacy, and the ability of crooks to anonymously use the system for illicit purposes. Those are all legitimate concerns, but to my mind, the biggest risks are financial, both to users of Libra and the financial system as a whole. Those risks include the possibility of bank runs, credit disruptions, or consumer losses arising from foreign currency risks or financial mismanagement of the Libra reserve. The best way to understand these risks is to follow the money. Let’s start with the process of buying and redeeming Libra. Most cryptocurrencies, including the granddaddy of them all, Bitcoin, have failed to gain widespread acceptance as a method of payment because of their volatility. Zuckerberg hopes to avoid this problem by backing Libra with a reserve of stable world currencies, including the dollar, Euro, and Swiss franc. So you can buy Libra with pretty much any fiat currency — a U.S. dollar, Brazilian Real, Mongolian Tugrik, Indian Rupee — but the amount of Libra you receive will depend on the exchange rate between your currency and the basket of currencies in the reserve at the time of purchase. When you want to redeem your Libra back into your fiat currency, you may get more. But you may also get a lot less, particularly in developing countries with unstable currencies. It will depend on the exchange rate at the time of redemption. Let’s say you still want to buy this hip new digital coin, regardless of the foreign exchange risk. Where do you get the money? For citizens in the U.S. and other developed countries, the money will probably come from your bank account. It’s not going to hurt the banking system if you withdraw a few hundred a month for Libra transactions. But what if everyone decides they want to replace their bank accounts with Libra? After all, this would be a great way to avoid checking account fees. Retailers will love Libra as a way to avoid paying network fees on debit and credit card transactions. All of a sudden, that giant sucking sound is money coming out of the banks and into Libra’s kitty. You may think, “Fine. Let’s stick it to the banks. Look what they did to the economy in 2008.” But most of that money you withdraw from the banks is money they will no longer have to lend to the economy. So as Libra captures your cash, banks have less to make loans. With a run on the banks, we also get a credit contraction. Now Libra has your money (not the banks) and you have your digital coins. What will Libra do with your money? Libra’s white paper says your digital coin is safe because it will be backed by a basket of the most stable world currencies. But it’s not as if Libra will be purchasing paper money in each of these currencies and piling them in a bank vault. What this really means is that Libra will be taking your money and investing it in instruments denominated in those currencies. The return on these investments is how Facebook and other Libra founders will make money. Thus they will have incentives to invest in instruments that will maximize those returns, which may or may not maintain the stable value Libra’s founders are promising. The white paper promises to invest in low volatility assets such as bank deposits and short-term government securities, using “investment grade” financial institutions as custodians. (Reminder: Lehman Bros had an “A” rating from Standard and Poor’s before its collapse in 2008.) But there is no regulatory body to ensure that it does so, nor to require that Libra’s sponsors put up any of their own capital or reserves to backstop those investments if they go sour. In essence, Libra proposes the failed business model used by money market funds prior to the financial crisis. It wants you to buy Libra on the promise that the coin will maintain stable value, but there will be no regulatory oversight of what Libra actually does with your money and no capital and liquidity requirements that you would typically find with a bank. That structure proved disastrous during the 2008 crisis, when the Reserve Fund, a money market fund that heavily invested in Lehman Bros debt, “broke the buck” and prompted widespread runs on other money market funds. Even if Libra keeps its promise to put your money only in relatively safe bank deposits and government securities, we still have a problem. If the money comes out of banks (where it supports private sector lending) and goes into government securities, we would see a massive re-allocation of resources from the private to the public sectors. If you believe (as do I) that the market is generally a better allocator of economic resources than the government, this re-allocation will serve as a drag on economic growth. Libra says it will also put your money into bank deposits. Bank accounts have the advantage of maintaining stable value. Your bank account balance doesn’t fluctuate as would a securities investment. And perhaps this helps with our bank run problem. You take money out of your bank to buy Libra. Libra puts yours and other users’ money into other banks, which will presumably use it to make loans. But banks do fail, and depositors take losses on their uninsured deposits. So while Libra is saying it’s offering a better alternative to banks because it won’t be taking risk by lending out your money the way banks do, it will be putting at least some of your money right back into banks of its choosing. When you withdrew money from your bank to buy Libra, you probably had less than $250,000 in your account, meaning it was fully protected by the FDIC. But Libra’s founders hope to have a global reserve of hundreds of billions of dollars. Even if they spread the funds among multiple banks, at those levels, the lion’s share will likely be uninsured. Anyone who has followed my writings on blockchain knows that I’m enthusiastic about the use of distributed ledger technology to remove frictions in the payments system. So I don’t mean to sound too negative. The problem is, so long as cryptocurrencies have to rely on fiat currencies to maintain stable value, they will be exposed to the same kinds of risks embedded in the banking systems that support those currencies. I believe most of these risks can be addressed with thoughtful regulation. But before Mark Zuckenberg or anyone else tries to create his own global currency, we need to settle on an adequate regulatory framework to govern them. It would make sense for Congress to give the Federal Reserve Board lead authority for overseeing Libra, given its responsibility to conduct monetary policy and oversee an effective and efficient payments system. It is also an experienced financial supervisor, well-equipped to develop capital and liquidity requirements for Libra and other such ventures. In exercising that authority, the Fed could build on the pioneering work of the New York Department of Financial Services which currently regulates two trust companies which have successfully launched stable coins backed by the U.S. dollar. (Disclosure. I serve on the board of one of those trusts, Paxos.) Technology has the potential to dramatically change how the world pays for things in the future. Whether that transition is beneficial to consumers and businesses or financially disruptive will depend on whether regulators can stay ahead of this potentially rapid transformation. It’s open to question whether Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are the right stewards for a new global cryptocurrency. But by firing this warning shot to government policy makers that such a change is coming and potentially coming soon, they have done a public service. Sheila Bair is the former Chair of the FDIC and has held senior appointments in both Republican and Democrat Administrations. She currently serves as a board member or advisor to a several companies and is a founding board member of the Volcker Alliance, a nonprofit established to rebuild trust in government.

Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date?," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook’s first foray into cryptocurrency is coming – first dubbed ‘Facebook Coin’, then ‘Global Coin’, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It’s at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle – the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don’t have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: “The Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.” So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it’s a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn’t allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves. Is there a darker side to Libra? The post Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date? appeared first on Coin Rivet."

Bitcoin Cash ABC broke through the first major resistance level at $409.98. Falling short of the 23.6% FIB of $418, Bitcoin Cash ABC pulled back to sub-$410 levels late in the day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was down by 1.15% to a morning low $402.37. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise to a morning high $406.63 before falling into the red. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move through to $408 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $415.68. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $416.8 would cap any upside on the day. Failure to move through to $408 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC fall deeper into the red. A fall through the first major support level at $399.55 would bring the second major support level at $392.04 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$390 levels. Litecoin slipped by 0.18% on Saturday. Following on from a 0.79% fall from Friday, Litecoin ended the day at $118.25. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin hit a morning high $120.91.

For the day ahead, a move back through the morning high to $119.30 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $121.26. Litecoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break clear of $120. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Saturday’s high $122.29 should limit the upside on the day. Failure to move through to $119.30 levels could see Litecoin slide back to $117 levels. In the event of an extended sell-off, Litecoin could fall through the 23.6% FIB of $117 to test the first major support level at $116.37 before any recovery. Ripple’s XRP rallied by 3.08% on Saturday. Reversing a 2.15% fall from Friday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.39155.

Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $0.4087. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164 would likely limit any upside on the day. Failure to move through to $0.3940 levels could see Ripple’s XRP slide through the morning low to sub-$0.3850 levels.

The Top 5 cryptocurrencies latest price," Today the price of Bitcoin is US$$11,158.25; Ethereum is US$290.43; XRP is US$0.389770; Bitcoin Cash is US$401.86 and Litecoin is US$119.90. These are the Top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. The top 5 cryptocurrencies are the biggest and most significant cryptocurrencies and constitute the top half of The Top 10 Cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. In August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are. The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without “relying on trust”. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number “0” (or the “genesis block”) which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) developed by the Ripple company. It is also referred to as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol. It can trace its roots to 2004 when a web developer called Ryan Fugger had the idea to create a monetary system that was decentralised and could effectively allow individuals to create their own money. Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on 30th July 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a white paper in 2013 describing Ethereum. Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn’t get buy-in to his proposal. Bitcoin Cash was born out of the idea of making Bitcoin more practical for small, day-to-day payments. In May 2017, Bitcoin payments took about four days unless a fee was paid, which was proportionately too large for small transactions. A change to the code was implemented and Bitcoin Cash was born on 1st August 2017. Litecoin was released in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee. It was a fork of Bitcoin with the main difference being a smaller block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, and a different script-based algorithm.

Coinsquare buys majority stake in Just Cash in bid to make world’s ATMs crypto-friendly," Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinsquare is making a bid to make digital assets more accessible.  Coinsquare has announced it has made a controlling investment in software provider Just Cash, whose tech will allow any ATM to sell cryptocurrency. The software does not disrupt the ATM network, no hardware changes are required and there are no additional costs to the operator. Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond believes crypto-friendly ATMs are key to making digital assets accessible to the masses.  “Right now, there is a lack of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption because most people are intimidated by the process to acquire it,” said Diamond. “By using the millions of existing ATMs around the world, we can now bridge the gap and give new users the easiest and most familiar experience to purchase cryptocurrency.”"
"SEC seeks blockchain data provider to monitor risk, improve compliance, and inform policy"," The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is getting ever more serious about blockchain data. While many of the world's governments and politicians focus on Facebook's recently introduced Libra and data sharing among virtual asset providers, the SEC is seeking more data on public blockchains. The requirements listed by the SEC specific that all data is sourced from hosted notes rather than blockchain explorers. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are mandatory, while Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Zcash, EOS, NEO and XRP data are all specified as desirable. In addition, as new blockchains gain increased prominence, the SEC would require support for them. The SEC is seeking full blockchain data from the genesis block or inception and information about any derivative currencies (tokens) affiliated with these blockchains. The required data format is very specific with normalized fields for each included blockchain sourced from on-node data, in its entirety. The minimum fields specified are ticker symbol; send and receive addresses; transaction hash, timestamp and amounts; unspent send and receive balances; transaction fees; confirmations; block hash; and block height. If possible, the SEC also seeks further metadata and chain metrics such as hashing algorithms, hashing power, mining difficulty and rewards, transactions quantity and size, coin supply and blockchain size. The data is expected to be provided directly by the vendor's own node for each blockchain using a secure, encrypted data feed; synced with the network; and run in a secure, controlled environment. The data must also be presented with means to validate its accuracy and completeness and meet the requirements of financial statement audit testing. The contract length will be for one year, followed by four optional 12 month terms. A technical quote and price quote are both required for application. The SEC's deadline for submission by prospective data vendors is 12pm EST on July 11, 2019. "
The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 05/07/19," Bitcoin led the way on Thursday, but this time for all the wrong reasons… Bitcoin tumbled by 6.85% on Thursday. Partially reversing Wednesday’s 10.09% rally to end the day at $11,162.5. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning intraday high $12,065 to a late morning low $11,503. The moves through the morning saw Bitcoin leave the major support and resistance levels untested. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin recovered to an afternoon high $11,922 before taking a hit in the final hour. The final hour sell-off saw Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33. For Bitcoin, the only positive of the day was the avoidance of sub-$11,000 levels for the first time since 29th June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was red for all but one of the top 10 cryptos on Thursday. Bucking the trend on the day was Binance Coin, which rose by 1.23%. It was deep red for the rest of the pack. Ethereum was close behind Bitcoin, sliding by 6.29%, with EOS (-5.62%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-5%) also seeing heavy losses. Things were not much better for Ripple’s XRP and Tron, which fell by 4.47% and 4.7% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin saw more modest losses on the day. While Bitcoin Cash SV fell by 3.44%, Litecoin fell by just 1.8%. The Bitcoin sell-off on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance pulling back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.5% The total crypto market cap fell from a high $338.45bn to end the day at $319.29bn on Thursday, weighed by Bitcoin’s pullback. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.35% to $11,201. Moves in the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $11,005 to a high $11,287 before easing back. Whilst leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 before the pullback. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.71%), EOS (+0.23%) and Ethereum (+0.25%) also found early support. Litecoin and Binance Coin struggled at the start, with losses of 0.56% and 0.6% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to $11,430 levels to support a reversal of Thursday’s losses. A move through to $11,500 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,800 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $11,287. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could touch $12,000 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,430 levels could see Bitcoin take another hit. A fall through the morning low $11,005 would bring the first major support level at $10,790 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $10,417.5 on the day.

"Bitcoin may soon go parabolic over $12,000 again"," Bitcoin is once more looking bullish as the world’s biggest decentralised asset has found a new influx of buying support to rally close to 20% in price since the start of July. On a backdrop of global turmoils driven by a narrative of trade tensions, a breakout in the gold and commodities markets, and even US President Donald Trump calling out China and Europe specifically for currency manipulation, could this be the perfect storm for Bitcoin to break past resistance and head upwards to fresh 2019 highs? China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for many years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019  Long-time Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos has reminded the community that governments may soon try and “blame crypto for the currency war”, but “the race to the bottom” for state-backed fiat currencies has little to do with the disruptive asset class. Towards the end of last week, Bitcoin continued to grind to defend its five-figure valuation. Unlike other downward price movements that we have seen of late, Bitcoin’s move down did not include any large-scale sell-offs, but instead a series of mini-dumps taking the price down from $12,000 to $10,000. Since this local bottom was hit, we have seen volumes pick up and buyers come back into the market to drive the price back up to the same level where the ‘controlled’ sell-off began. If Bitcoin can now penetrate through the $12,000-$12,400 level of resistance, the move back up to $14,000 and beyond may be quicker than its initial parabolic rise in late June. If the digitally-scarce asset does decide to rally up from this point, the odds of ever seeing an exchange-traded price of under $10,000 will decrease exponentially as fast as any potential move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency. That is why we are all here.  Anything short of this becomes much less interesting. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 4, 2019    The popular Bitcoin analyst Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano recently outlined his $100,000 Bitcoin target for the end of 2021, but the chances are that if we do see all-time highs broken sooner rather than later, a six-figure valuation for Bitcoin may become a reality quicker than even the most bullish commentators in the space would ever expect.

Bucking the trend in the early hours, however, was Binance Coin with a 0.31% loss. Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to bring the first major resistance level at $11,323.93 into play. Having failed to touch $11,000 levels on Tuesday, the early move should support a bullish day ahead. An early break through the first major resistance level would bring $11,500 levels into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall back through to $10,500 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,087.13 into play.

Bitcoin Tech Analysis – Recap and Mid-Day Review – 04/07/19," Bitcoin rallied by 10.09% on Wednesday. Following on from a 2.29% gain on Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,983. A bullish start to the day set the tone, with Bitcoin on the move from the start of the day. Bitcoin rallied from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. The moves through the early hours saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and the first major resistance level at $11,762.87. A pullback to sub-$11,000 levels by late morning saw Bitcoin steer clear of the first major support level at $10,087.13 before a late rally. The late rally saw Bitcoin break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275, first major resistance level at $11,323.93, and second major resistance level at $11,762.87 to hit an intraday high $12,025. Resistance at $12,000 limited the upside on the day. The Bitcoin rally led to Bitcoin’s dominance rising back to 62% levels. Bitcoin’s market cap jumped to a Wednesday high $213.5bn before easing back. Bitcoin ultimately provided support to the broader crypto market, leading the majors into positive territory on the day. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December’s swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin continued to find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Wednesday’s rally was another day of correlation with the more mature markets. The rally kicked in well ahead of economic data out of the U.S, however. Weak U.S stats continued to support the FED’s projected rate cut later in the day year. While the cheaper cost of funds is a boon for riskier assets, the current interest rate environment continues to be supportive. A negative for Bitcoin and the broader market continues to be the prospect of a material shift in the regulatory landscape. There’s also the pending SEC decisions on the Bitcoin ETFs to consider. The recent volatility across the broader market has come at the wrong time for those hoping for Bitcoin ETFs to be approved. The good news, however, is the fact that there have been no headline cases of exchanges being hacked… Another piece of good news is the fact that the planned launch of Facebook’s Libra has done no damage just yet… At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.63% to $11,787. In the early part of the day, Bitcoin rose to a start of a day high $12,065 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,379.33, Bitcoin fell back to a late morning low $11,503. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33, Bitcoin moved back through to $11,700 levels. For the Bitcoin bulls, $12,000 looks to be the line in the sand. A hold onto $11,700 levels through the early afternoon would support a move back through to $11,900 levels. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $12,065. In the event of a breakout, the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 would come into play before any pullback. Failure to hold onto $11,700 levels could see Bitcoin slide back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Barring an extended sell-off through the afternoon, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit the downside. In the event of a sell-off, expect a return to sub-$11,000 levels before finding support.

"KuCoin launches derivatives trading platform KuMEX, promises up to 20x leverage"," Count this as the latest attempt by a cryptocurrency exchange to take a piece of the perpetual swap pie. IDG-backed KuCoin has announced the beta launch of its derivatives trading platform, KuMEX. To start, the new platform will offer trading of its so-called Bitcoin Perpetual Contract (XBTUSDM).  KuCoin is the latest cryptocurrency exchange to announce its intention to gatecrash the market for cryptocurrency derivatives, a space currently dominated by behemoth BitMEX. Houbi, Binance, and Bitfinex have recently launched or announced the impending launch of their own platforms to trade perpetual swaps, a synthetic way to bet on cryptocurrencies.  As part of its attempt to lure traders to the new venue, KuMEX will offer rebates to certain traders. “At the same time, KuMEX offers a negative fee for Makers at a rate of -0.025% with a certain amount of fixed commission, encouraging users to provide liquidity to the platform through making the market and earning some commission as an incentive,” the press release reads. Furthermore, the platform uses Bitcoin Spot Index that volume-weights the price of bitcoin in six major exchanges—Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, Liquid and Bittrex. According to the press release, by using figures from more exchanges, KuMEX hopes to achieve a more “fair and rigorous” bitcoin index price. Meanwhile, rival BitMEX prices its swaps based on data from a pool of three exchanges.  KuCoin also announced a trading competition, with a reward of 10,000 KCS for users with top scores in their return rate ranking."
Ethereum Analysis – Support Levels in Play – 03/07/19," It’s been a bearish first half of the week. Following last week’s 2.76% gain, Ethereum was down by 8.13%, Sunday through Tuesday. A bearish start to the week saw Ethereum slide by 8.51% on Sunday to set the tone early on. In spite of finding support on Monday to hold on to $290 levels, with a 1.25% gain, the reversal continued on Tuesday. Ethereum fell by a further 0.84% to end the day at $291.25. Falling from a current week high $323.61 from Sunday, Ethereum fell to a current week low $270.42 on Tuesday. Steering well clear of the first major resistance level at $363.16, Ethereum fell through the first major support level at $272.17 before recovering to $291 levels. While falling back from the 38.2% FIB of $367, Ethereum managed to steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $257. The extended bearish trend, formed at last May 2018’s swing hi $828.97, remained firmly intact, however. Ethereum continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $367, following December’s swing lo $80.6. For the bulls, a breakout from the 38.2% FIB of $367 would be needed to form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 0.67% to $293.19. A move back through to $320 levels would signal a 2nd half of a week rebound. Ethereum would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $300. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, a move through to $320 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $363.16 into play. Barring a crypto rally going into the weekend, however, the first major resistance level and the 38.2% FIB would cap any upside in the event of a bounce back. With volatility returning to the broader market, a break through the 38.2% FIB would bring $400 levels into view. Failure to move through to $320 levels would likely leave Ethereum on the back foot through the week. A fall through the current week low $270.42 could see Ethereum slide through the 23.6% FIB of $257 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ethereum should steer well clear of the second major support level at $227.34. A visit to $260 levels would be on the cards, however, in the event of a sell-off. Major Support Level: $272.17 Major Resistance Level: $363.16 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $257 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $367 62% FIB Retracement Level: $543 This article was originally posted on FX Empire"
Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto," In a recent interview on London Real, the Bitcoin and open blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos talked about the wrong type of people entering the digital asset economy, and why many end up staying for different reasons other than price. On the topic of the many hype-based cryptocurrency projects we see today, Antonopoulos said that the industry sometimes attracts the wrong type of crowd into the ecosystem. “It attracts scammers, opportunists, pump and dumpers, and pyramid schemes, and the ICO market enabled a lot of those people to make their own coins.” Andreas said that one of the reasons the ICO craze happened was because Ethereum made it easy for people to build a scalable, secure, transferable, and censorship-resistant blockchain “just by writing 20 lines of code”. But the Mastering Ethereum author said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains “to build platforms to do massive pump and dumps” instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance. However, he did mention that in the long run, “if you can fund start-ups with an international pool of investors, that can change the investment fields”. FOMO is in the air. Newbies are joining the cryptocurrency space and falling prey to scammers.  Please educate your friends and family:– Promises of profit are 100% ponzi– Request to ""recruit"", ""affiliate"" etc are 100% pyramid schemes– ICO/IEO are 99.99% pump-and-dump — Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) June 20, 2019  Regarding the parabolic rises and falls of many crypto assets, Andreas said that “nothing goes exponential without going down”, and that Bitcoin has done this eight times already as “that’s how it grows”. “The reason it grows like this is that there isn’t much in terms of short pressure to hold it down,” he said. “If you’ve got something that has limited supply and you suddenly have a speculative mania that blows up, it will continue to go up in a straight line, which only further fuels the mania. “Until it reaches a point where there simply isn’t anybody else who feels just as enthusiastic and it pauses for a second, the panic just drives [the price] down.” Andreas said that there’s “no difference between speculators and investors” and that they’re just speculating with a different risk profile, with some of them doing so “with very little research and information”. He said that the reason this is bad is that “a lot of good, innocent, and slightly naive people lost a lot of money” and had their lives destroyed because of this. This has a negative effect “as it changes the community” and “causes damage to the community”. “You have a lot of drama that comes up when there’s money on the table – people’s personalities change.” He said that people start taking shortcuts and their ethics become compromised – “power corrupts, money corrupts”. Andreas said that the majority of people first got involved in crypto most likely “because they heard that it’s some kind of investment opportunity”. He made the case that even though many of these people may have first entered the space “because of speculation and mania”, the people who were only motivated by price left during the 2018 crash, with those who stayed “finding other motivations”. He claimed some of the reasons why people stay is because they like the community, they understand the technology, and they may even be “driven by the political implications”. To those people, Andreas said: “Welcome, you may have come because you want to get rich – that’s okay. Now let me tell you about why you should stay because of the technology even after the price crashes.”   The post Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto appeared first on Coin Rivet."

Whilst steering clear of the major support and resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, Litecoin recovered from early losses to move into the green, up by 0.06% at the time of writing. Joining Litecoin in the green were EOS (+0.54%), Ethereum (+0.18%) and Binance Coin (+0.02%). Bitcoin Cash ABC joined Bitcoin in the red with a -1.64%, while Bitcoin Cash SV was flat. Bitcoin would need to break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 to $11,320 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $11,680.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $11,720 would likely limit any upside. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,320 levels could see Bitcoin slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $11,111 would bring the first major support level at $10,921.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,900 levels on the day. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today This article was originally posted on FX Empire"
The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 04/07/19," Bitcoin led the way on Wednesday, providing much-needed support to the broader market at the turn of the quarter.

A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major resistance level at $11,323.93 before hitting reverse. Bitcoin fell back through the 23.6% FIB to sub-$11,000 levels before bouncing back to $11,500 levels.

The late rally saw Bitcoin rise from an afternoon low $11,038 to a late intraday high $12,025. Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB, first major resistance level at $11,323.93 and second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of green across the crypto-board. Coming in a distant second to Bitcoin was Ethereum, which gained 3.62%. Bitcoin Cash SV (+3.03%), Litecoin (+2.69%), EOS (+2.39%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.25%), Tron (+2.14%) and Binance Coin (+2.10%) also made solid gains on the day.

Amongst the cryptos in reverse, Bitcoin Cash SV saw the most modest loss, down by 0.02% at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,800 levels through the morning to support a rebound later in the day. A move through the morning high $12,065 would bring the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high. Failure to hold onto $11,800 levels could see Bitcoin cough up Wednesday’s gains. A fall through to sub-$11,630 levels would bring the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit any downside in the event of an extended sell-off.

Ethereum Analysis – Support Levels in Play – 03/07/19," It’s been a bearish first half of the week. Following last week’s 2.76% gain, Ethereum was down by 8.13%, Sunday through Tuesday. A bearish start to the week saw Ethereum slide by 8.51% on Sunday to set the tone early on. In spite of finding support on Monday to hold on to $290 levels, with a 1.25% gain, the reversal continued on Tuesday. Ethereum fell by a further 0.84% to end the day at $291.25. Falling from a current week high $323.61 from Sunday, Ethereum fell to a current week low $270.42 on Tuesday. Steering well clear of the first major resistance level at $363.16, Ethereum fell through the first major support level at $272.17 before recovering to $291 levels. While falling back from the 38.2% FIB of $367, Ethereum managed to steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $257. The extended bearish trend, formed at last May 2018’s swing hi $828.97, remained firmly intact, however. Ethereum continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $367, following December’s swing lo $80.6. For the bulls, a breakout from the 38.2% FIB of $367 would be needed to form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 0.67% to $293.19. A move back through to $320 levels would signal a 2nd half of a week rebound. Ethereum would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $300. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, a move through to $320 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $363.16 into play. Barring a crypto rally going into the weekend, however, the first major resistance level and the 38.2% FIB would cap any upside in the event of a bounce back. With volatility returning to the broader market, a break through the 38.2% FIB would bring $400 levels into view. Failure to move through to $320 levels would likely leave Ethereum on the back foot through the week. A fall through the current week low $270.42 could see Ethereum slide through the 23.6% FIB of $257 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ethereum should steer well clear of the second major support level at $227.34. A visit to $260 levels would be on the cards, however, in the event of a sell-off. Major Support Level: $272.17 Major Resistance Level: $363.16 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $257 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $367 62% FIB Retracement Level: $543 This article was originally posted on FX Empire",Bob Mason,"<span class=""provider-link"" data-reactid=""12"" itemprop=""name""><a class=""Fz(12px) C(#222) Fw(b)"" data-reactid=""13"" href=""https://www.fxempire.com/"" itemprop=""url"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FX Empire</a></span>"
Coinsquare buys majority stake in Just Cash in bid to make world’s ATMs crypto-friendly," Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinsquare is making a bid to make digital assets more accessible.  Coinsquare has announced it has made a controlling investment in software provider Just Cash, whose tech will allow any ATM to sell cryptocurrency. The software does not disrupt the ATM network, no hardware changes are required and there are no additional costs to the operator. Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond believes crypto-friendly ATMs are key to making digital assets accessible to the masses.  “Right now, there is a lack of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption because most people are intimidated by the process to acquire it,” said Diamond. “By using the millions of existing ATMs around the world, we can now bridge the gap and give new users the easiest and most familiar experience to purchase cryptocurrency.”",Carol Gaszcz,"<span class=""provider-link"" data-reactid=""12"" itemprop=""name""><a class=""Fz(12px) C(#222) Fw(b)"" data-reactid=""13"" href=""https://www.theblockcrypto.com/"" itemprop=""url"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Block</a></span>"
"KuCoin launches derivatives trading platform KuMEX, promises up to 20x leverage"," Count this as the latest attempt by a cryptocurrency exchange to take a piece of the perpetual swap pie. IDG-backed KuCoin has announced the beta launch of its derivatives trading platform, KuMEX. To start, the new platform will offer trading of its so-called Bitcoin Perpetual Contract (XBTUSDM).  KuCoin is the latest cryptocurrency exchange to announce its intention to gatecrash the market for cryptocurrency derivatives, a space currently dominated by behemoth BitMEX. Houbi, Binance, and Bitfinex have recently launched or announced the impending launch of their own platforms to trade perpetual swaps, a synthetic way to bet on cryptocurrencies.  As part of its attempt to lure traders to the new venue, KuMEX will offer rebates to certain traders. “At the same time, KuMEX offers a negative fee for Makers at a rate of -0.025% with a certain amount of fixed commission, encouraging users to provide liquidity to the platform through making the market and earning some commission as an incentive,” the press release reads. Furthermore, the platform uses Bitcoin Spot Index that volume-weights the price of bitcoin in six major exchanges—Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, Liquid and Bittrex. According to the press release, by using figures from more exchanges, KuMEX hopes to achieve a more “fair and rigorous” bitcoin index price. Meanwhile, rival BitMEX prices its swaps based on data from a pool of three exchanges.  KuCoin also announced a trading competition, with a reward of 10,000 KCS for users with top scores in their return rate ranking.",Carol Gaszcz,"<span class=""provider-link"" data-reactid=""12"" itemprop=""name""><a class=""Fz(12px) C(#222) Fw(b)"" data-reactid=""13"" href=""https://www.theblockcrypto.com/"" itemprop=""url"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Block</a></span>"
Making this easy to understand isn’t easy," Having recently read an article on the BBC website purporting to try and explain the importance of blockchain to the world’s economy, I was struck by the intellectual muddiness of these waters and how easy it is to confuse blockchain with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with altcoins. It really is no wonder that the “man on the street” doesn’t understand these things, and consequently these misconceptions have become a real barrier to mainstream adoption. At the heart of blockchain, it really isn’t much more than a ledger or database (dependent on which descriptor you prefer). A blockchain database is unique, however, through its three pillars of being distributed (multiple copies of), being decentralised (no one copy has version control), and immutable (each transaction recorded is unchangeable). Bitcoin was the first blockchain, and as such is frequently referred to when trying to explain or understand blockchain. What the Bitcoin protocol (the underlying rules of the blockchain) solved technically was the double spend problem. This was key to creating a digital cash that was unforgeable. It’s easy to go too far down the rabbit hole on Bitcoin and start looking at the economic programming and proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors, but this takes us away from understanding blockchain. In order to offer a simple explanation of the difference between blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it’s best to use the analogy of the internet and email. Email, it’s widely agreed, was the internet’s first killer app – so email is simply an application built on top of the internet, but the internet offers far more than just email. Similarly, Bitcoin was blockchain’s first killer app, and as such, all cryptocurrency is built on top of a blockchain – but blockchain can do so much more than just cryptocurrency. With blockchain working as a shared ledger and acting as a trusted central source of truth, we can see organisations looking to solve such complex topics as digital identity (Sovrin), supply chain digital transformation (Tradelens), food provenance (IBM Food Trust), and efficiency in the transportation and logistic industry (BITA). Under the cloak of darkness, many companies are aiming to create proof of concepts that can deliver real-world results for their various industries. In time, the cloak will be lifted and we will see which ones have succeeded and, hopefully, which ones have failed and we can learn from. The Bitcoin protocol is slow, but this is not the protocol that would be used in enterprise environments. The Bitcoin protocol is energy hungry (through PoW), but enterprise blockchains would not use PoW as its consensus mechanism. If you’re looking at having a digital form of money, it makes sense that there should be a cost to creating it in the form of energy consumption. If you’re aiming to clean up the luxury goods markets from fakes and rip-offs, a consortia of luxury goods manufacturers and retailers using proof of authority makes sense – it really is a case of horses for courses. The article also discusses the value that many intermediaries have, and this isn’t wrong. There are plenty of middlemen that actually add value to our every day lives, including the basic function of banking to be the trusted custodian of our money. However, there are also plenty of things that commercial banks do that do not add value, and we should take back sovereignty over – international transfers of money for one. Centralised third-party middlemen are not the problem, the degree to which we can trust them to act on our behalf is. The BBC article misunderstands a basic precept about Bitcoin regarding the speed of transactions by comparing it to Mastercard and Visa. A better comparison for Bitcoin is gold, where transaction in the metal takes a long time and costs a lot of money as it’s generally done as a settlement layer at central bank level. One day in the future, I, and many others believe that Bitcoin will be able to be used as simply as Mastercard or Visa is today, but that requires a layer two solution (such as Lightning), and a much more significant market cap that would be in the trillions of dollars. We may be some way from that being a reality at the present time, but that is just a reason why we should make the effort to understand these issues today. The article jumps to talking about problems with other blockchain based currencies, known as altcoins, but without creating a clear distinction from Bitcoin and creating the clarification that there is no “the blockchain”, but actually many different flavours of the same concept. Many of the altcoins, are based upon a token that drives actions on top of the matching blockchain. For example, Ethereum was a new protocol that went live in 2015 and was intended to be a decentralised global computer with the ability to execute smart contracts. Ether was the token created both as a way to raise the initial funds to build the technology and is now the gas that powers it. Ethereum also paved the way for a glut of new tokens created by entrepreneurs (and scammers) on top of the Ethereum protocol, most of which only had a utility within the application built on top of it. Many people have tried to create new cryptocurrencies, some through forks of pre-existing protocols and coins (such as Bitcoin), and some as entirely new protocols. For some of the entrepreneurs that went down this road, it was little more than a way of making themselves rich. However the main problem with the altcoins when trying to be viewed as money, is that they tend to be overly centralised (meaning that the transactions and rules of the currency won’t have as much trust), and look to reduce energy consumption and speed up transaction throughput through different consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated PoS, and tend to lack scarcity – if you understand economics, it’s fairly easy to see that without significant cost and scarcity, there can be no significant value created with respect to money. Again, look at the comparison to finding and excavating gold from the earth. My belief is that in ten years’ time, Bitcoin will have either changed the world we live in or will have become virtually valueless. Conversely, I believe that blockchain is here to stay and will change the world but needs to fade into the background. The reality is that blockchain is still mostly hype, as was the internet in 1994. The industry needs time to develop – just because it’s hype today, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t real world-changing tech there.

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 03/07/19," Bitcoin continued its trend-bucking form on Tuesday to end a string of losses at the turn of the quarter. Bitcoin rose by 2.29% on Tuesday. Reversing a 1.48% fall from Monday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,885. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide from a morning high $10,719 to a late morning intraday low $9,728.2. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $10,075 to test support at the 38.2% FIB of $9,734 before bouncing back. Rallying through the afternoon, Bitcoin struck a late intraday high $10,965 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin fell well short of the first major resistance level at $11,218. It was Bitcoin’s first visit to sub-$10,000 levels since 21st June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red across the crypto-board. Leading the way down was Binance Coin, which slid by 3.65%. Also seeing heavy losses were Litecoin (-3.26%), Tron (-2.89%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (-2.59%), and EOS (-2.37%). Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash SV saw more modest losses of 0.84% and 0.48% respectively. For Stellar’s Lumen, things haven’t improved since falling out of the top ten with a 2.16% loss on the day. With Bitcoin bucking the trend to see green on the day, Bitcoin’s dominance moved back to 61% levels. The total crypto market cap recovered from sub-$290 levels on Tuesday to end the day at $313.2bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 2.73% to $11,182 as the bulls look to restore order. Moves within the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a low $10,876 to a high $11,200 before easing back. While leaving the major support and resistance levels untested early on, Bitcoin came within range of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day for the majors. Ethereum tracked Bitcoin early on, with a 1.01% gain. Tron (+0.94%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.03%), and Litecoin (+1.18%) also made solid gains. Bucking the trend in the early hours, however, was Binance Coin with a 0.31% loss. Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to bring the first major resistance level at $11,323.93 into play. Having failed to touch $11,000 levels on Tuesday, the early move should support a bullish day ahead. An early break through the first major resistance level would bring $11,500 levels into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall back through to $10,500 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,087.13 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,000 support levels on the day.

"Bitcoin may soon go parabolic over $12,000 again"," Bitcoin is once more looking bullish as the world’s biggest decentralised asset has found a new influx of buying support to rally close to 20% in price since the start of July. On a backdrop of global turmoils driven by a narrative of trade tensions, a breakout in the gold and commodities markets, and even US President Donald Trump calling out China and Europe specifically for currency manipulation, could this be the perfect storm for Bitcoin to break past resistance and head upwards to fresh 2019 highs? China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for many years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019  Long-time Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos has reminded the community that governments may soon try and “blame crypto for the currency war”, but “the race to the bottom” for state-backed fiat currencies has little to do with the disruptive asset class. Towards the end of last week, Bitcoin continued to grind to defend its five-figure valuation. Unlike other downward price movements that we have seen of late, Bitcoin’s move down did not include any large-scale sell-offs, but instead a series of mini-dumps taking the price down from $12,000 to $10,000. Since this local bottom was hit, we have seen volumes pick up and buyers come back into the market to drive the price back up to the same level where the ‘controlled’ sell-off began. If Bitcoin can now penetrate through the $12,000-$12,400 level of resistance, the move back up to $14,000 and beyond may be quicker than its initial parabolic rise in late June. If the digitally-scarce asset does decide to rally up from this point, the odds of ever seeing an exchange-traded price of under $10,000 will decrease exponentially as fast as any potential move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency. That is why we are all here.  Anything short of this becomes much less interesting. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 4, 2019    The popular Bitcoin analyst Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano recently outlined his $100,000 Bitcoin target for the end of 2021, but the chances are that if we do see all-time highs broken sooner rather than later, a six-figure valuation for Bitcoin may become a reality quicker than even the most bullish commentators in the space would ever expect.

"SEC seeks blockchain data provider to monitor risk, improve compliance, and inform policy"," The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is getting ever more serious about blockchain data. While many of the world's governments and politicians focus on Facebook's recently introduced Libra and data sharing among virtual asset providers, the SEC is seeking more data on public blockchains. The requirements listed by the SEC specific that all data is sourced from hosted notes rather than blockchain explorers. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are mandatory, while Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Zcash, EOS, NEO and XRP data are all specified as desirable. In addition, as new blockchains gain increased prominence, the SEC would require support for them. The SEC is seeking full blockchain data from the genesis block or inception and information about any derivative currencies (tokens) affiliated with these blockchains. The required data format is very specific with normalized fields for each included blockchain sourced from on-node data, in its entirety. The minimum fields specified are ticker symbol; send and receive addresses; transaction hash, timestamp and amounts; unspent send and receive balances; transaction fees; confirmations; block hash; and block height. If possible, the SEC also seeks further metadata and chain metrics such as hashing algorithms, hashing power, mining difficulty and rewards, transactions quantity and size, coin supply and blockchain size. The data is expected to be provided directly by the vendor's own node for each blockchain using a secure, encrypted data feed; synced with the network; and run in a secure, controlled environment. The data must also be presented with means to validate its accuracy and completeness and meet the requirements of financial statement audit testing. The contract length will be for one year, followed by four optional 12 month terms. A technical quote and price quote are both required for application. The SEC's deadline for submission by prospective data vendors is 12pm EST on July 11, 2019. ","<div class=""author Mb(4px) D(ib) Mend(4px)"" data-reactid=""7"" itemprop=""author creator"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""><a class=""author-link Td(u):h Lh(18px) Td(n) Fw(b) Fz(12px) C(#000)"" data-reactid=""8"" href=""https://www.theblockcrypto.com/"" itemprop=""name"" rel=""noopener noreferrer nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Block</a></div>",None
Making this easy to understand isn’t easy," Having recently read an article on the BBC website purporting to try and explain the importance of blockchain to the world’s economy, I was struck by the intellectual muddiness of these waters and how easy it is to confuse blockchain with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with altcoins. It really is no wonder that the “man on the street” doesn’t understand these things, and consequently these misconceptions have become a real barrier to mainstream adoption. At the heart of blockchain, it really isn’t much more than a ledger or database (dependent on which descriptor you prefer). A blockchain database is unique, however, through its three pillars of being distributed (multiple copies of), being decentralised (no one copy has version control), and immutable (each transaction recorded is unchangeable). Bitcoin was the first blockchain, and as such is frequently referred to when trying to explain or understand blockchain. What the Bitcoin protocol (the underlying rules of the blockchain) solved technically was the double spend problem. This was key to creating a digital cash that was unforgeable. It’s easy to go too far down the rabbit hole on Bitcoin and start looking at the economic programming and proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors, but this takes us away from understanding blockchain. In order to offer a simple explanation of the difference between blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it’s best to use the analogy of the internet and email. Email, it’s widely agreed, was the internet’s first killer app – so email is simply an application built on top of the internet, but the internet offers far more than just email. Similarly, Bitcoin was blockchain’s first killer app, and as such, all cryptocurrency is built on top of a blockchain – but blockchain can do so much more than just cryptocurrency. With blockchain working as a shared ledger and acting as a trusted central source of truth, we can see organisations looking to solve such complex topics as digital identity (Sovrin), supply chain digital transformation (Tradelens), food provenance (IBM Food Trust), and efficiency in the transportation and logistic industry (BITA). Under the cloak of darkness, many companies are aiming to create proof of concepts that can deliver real-world results for their various industries. In time, the cloak will be lifted and we will see which ones have succeeded and, hopefully, which ones have failed and we can learn from. The Bitcoin protocol is slow, but this is not the protocol that would be used in enterprise environments. The Bitcoin protocol is energy hungry (through PoW), but enterprise blockchains would not use PoW as its consensus mechanism. If you’re looking at having a digital form of money, it makes sense that there should be a cost to creating it in the form of energy consumption. If you’re aiming to clean up the luxury goods markets from fakes and rip-offs, a consortia of luxury goods manufacturers and retailers using proof of authority makes sense – it really is a case of horses for courses. The article also discusses the value that many intermediaries have, and this isn’t wrong. There are plenty of middlemen that actually add value to our every day lives, including the basic function of banking to be the trusted custodian of our money. However, there are also plenty of things that commercial banks do that do not add value, and we should take back sovereignty over – international transfers of money for one. Centralised third-party middlemen are not the problem, the degree to which we can trust them to act on our behalf is. The BBC article misunderstands a basic precept about Bitcoin regarding the speed of transactions by comparing it to Mastercard and Visa. A better comparison for Bitcoin is gold, where transaction in the metal takes a long time and costs a lot of money as it’s generally done as a settlement layer at central bank level. One day in the future, I, and many others believe that Bitcoin will be able to be used as simply as Mastercard or Visa is today, but that requires a layer two solution (such as Lightning), and a much more significant market cap that would be in the trillions of dollars. We may be some way from that being a reality at the present time, but that is just a reason why we should make the effort to understand these issues today. The article jumps to talking about problems with other blockchain based currencies, known as altcoins, but without creating a clear distinction from Bitcoin and creating the clarification that there is no “the blockchain”, but actually many different flavours of the same concept. Many of the altcoins, are based upon a token that drives actions on top of the matching blockchain. For example, Ethereum was a new protocol that went live in 2015 and was intended to be a decentralised global computer with the ability to execute smart contracts. Ether was the token created both as a way to raise the initial funds to build the technology and is now the gas that powers it. Ethereum also paved the way for a glut of new tokens created by entrepreneurs (and scammers) on top of the Ethereum protocol, most of which only had a utility within the application built on top of it. Many people have tried to create new cryptocurrencies, some through forks of pre-existing protocols and coins (such as Bitcoin), and some as entirely new protocols. For some of the entrepreneurs that went down this road, it was little more than a way of making themselves rich. However the main problem with the altcoins when trying to be viewed as money, is that they tend to be overly centralised (meaning that the transactions and rules of the currency won’t have as much trust), and look to reduce energy consumption and speed up transaction throughput through different consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated PoS, and tend to lack scarcity – if you understand economics, it’s fairly easy to see that without significant cost and scarcity, there can be no significant value created with respect to money. Again, look at the comparison to finding and excavating gold from the earth. My belief is that in ten years’ time, Bitcoin will have either changed the world we live in or will have become virtually valueless. Conversely, I believe that blockchain is here to stay and will change the world but needs to fade into the background. The reality is that blockchain is still mostly hype, as was the internet in 1994. The industry needs time to develop – just because it’s hype today, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t real world-changing tech there.

Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of “digital payment tokens” in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, “will not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.” The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: “(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.”  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. “A digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,” it said.","<div class=""author Mb(4px) D(ib) Mend(4px)"" data-reactid=""8"" itemprop=""author creator"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""><div class=""author-name Lh(18px) Td(n) Fw(b) Fz(12px) C(#000)"" data-reactid=""9"" itemprop=""name"">Yogita Khatri</div></div>",The Block
"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 06/07/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC rose by 0.46% on Friday. Partially reversing a 5% slide from Thursday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $400.0. A choppy day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC slide to a mid-morning intraday low $393.06 before finding support. Steering clear of the first major support level at $390.63, Bitcoin Cash ABC rallied to a late morning intraday high $411.50. In spite of the upswing, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell short of the first major resistance level at $413.25 and 23.6% FIB of $418. Easing back through the afternoon, Bitcoin Cash ABC slid back to $396 levels before a late recovery to $400 levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 1.13% to $404.5. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $400.67 to a high $404.5. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold above $401.5 would support a run at the first major resistance level at $409.98. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the continued support of the broader market, however, to take a run on Thursday’s high $411.5. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin Cash ABC would likely fall short of recovery through the 23.6% FIB of $418.0. Failure to hold above $401.5 could see Bitcoin Cash ABC test the first major support level at $391.54. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$390 support levels on the day. Litecoin fell by 0.79% on Friday. Following on from a 1.8% fall from Thursday, Litecoin ended the day at $118.54. A choppy morning saw Litecoin fall to a low $116.88 before striking a late morning intraday high $120.85. The early pullback saw Litecoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $117 to come within range of the first major support level at $116.62. In spite of rebound, Litecoin fell short of the first major resistance level at $124.96. Pulling back through the afternoon, Litecoin fell back through the 23.6% FIB to an intraday low $116.56. Litecoin tested the first major support level at $116.62 for a 2nd time on the day before a recovering to $119 levels. A late pullback saw Litecoin fall back into the red for the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up 1.28% to $120.06. Tracking the broader market, Litecoin rose from a morning low $118.41 to a high $120.79 before easing back. Steering clear of the major support levels, the first major resistance level at $120.74 pinned Litecoin back early on. For the day ahead, a hold above $118 levels would support another move through the first major resistance level at $120.74. Litecoin would need support from the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $122.94. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Thursday’s high $120.85 and the first major resistance level would likely limit any upside. Failure to hold above $118 levels could see Litecoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $117. The first major support level at $116.45 would likely limit any downside.

Whilst leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 before the pullback. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.71%), EOS (+0.23%) and Ethereum (+0.25%) also found early support. Litecoin and Binance Coin struggled at the start, with losses of 0.56% and 0.6% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to $11,430 levels to support a reversal of Thursday’s losses. A move through to $11,500 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,800 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $11,287. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could touch $12,000 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,430 levels could see Bitcoin take another hit. A fall through the morning low $11,005 would bring the first major support level at $10,790 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $10,417.5 on the day.

Following on from a 0.46% gain from Friday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $407.05. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from an intraday low $400.67 to a morning high $406.43 before easing back to $401 levels. Steering clear of the major support and resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $416.8. Bitcoin Cash ABC broke through the first major resistance level at $409.98. Falling short of the 23.6% FIB of $418, Bitcoin Cash ABC pulled back to sub-$410 levels late in the day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was down by 1.15% to a morning low $402.37. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise to a morning high $406.63 before falling into the red. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move through to $408 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $415.68. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $416.8 would cap any upside on the day. Failure to move through to $408 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC fall deeper into the red. A fall through the first major support level at $399.55 would bring the second major support level at $392.04 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$390 levels. Litecoin slipped by 0.18% on Saturday. Following on from a 0.79% fall from Friday, Litecoin ended the day at $118.25. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin hit a morning high $120.91. Coming up against the first major resistance level at $120.74 Litecoin pulled back to a morning low $118.18. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $117 and first major support level at $116.27, Litecoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $122.29. Litecoin broke back through the first major resistance level at $120.74 before sliding to a late intraday low $117.3. Finding support at the 23.6% FIB of $117, Litecoin recovered to $118 levels to limit the downside on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 0.18% to $118.04. A choppy start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a morning low $117.43 to a high $119.14 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move back through the morning high to $119.30 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $121.26. Litecoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break clear of $120. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Saturday’s high $122.29 should limit the upside on the day. Failure to move through to $119.30 levels could see Litecoin slide back to $117 levels. In the event of an extended sell-off, Litecoin could fall through the 23.6% FIB of $117 to test the first major support level at $116.37 before any recovery. Ripple’s XRP rallied by 3.08% on Saturday. Reversing a 2.15% fall from Friday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.39155. Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP rose from an intraday low $0.37936 to a morning high $0.38738. Ripple’s XRP came within range the first major resistance level at $0.3878 before easing back to $0.381 levels.

For the day ahead, a move through to $0.3940 levels would support a return to $0.40 levels. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $0.4087. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164 would likely limit any upside on the day. Failure to move through to $0.3940 levels could see Ripple’s XRP slide through the morning low to sub-$0.3850 levels. Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of the first major support level at $0.3769.

Casa rolls out cryptocurrency mobile app to attract bitcoin novices," Cryptocurrency custody startup Casa has rolled out a new mobile app.  Sats App is a noncustodial wallet that allows users to manage their lightning nodes straight from their mobile phone, CoinDesk writes. Casa is planning to add a rewards program to attract more cryptocurrency early adopters, who can earn cryptocurrency and learn about cryptocurrencies and node management. “Features are focused on increasing adoption of bitcoin and lightning nodes,” said Casa CEO Jeremy Welch. “You will be able to earn bitcoin if you don’t have a Casa node, but you will be able to earn bitcoin faster if you have a node.” The app will currently be available only to Casa customers, with a full roll-out planned for later this month. According to Welch, although the app is “lightweight,” it offers multiple actions — earning sats and operating a full node. “It’s private, secure and connects over Tor,” he added. Earlier this year, Casa announced a “core shift” to its business, launching the Keymaster mobile app and plug-and-play Bitcoin Lightning node Casa Node. ","<div class=""author Mb(4px) D(ib) Mend(4px)"" data-reactid=""8"" itemprop=""author creator"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""><div class=""author-name Lh(18px) Td(n) Fw(b) Fz(12px) C(#000)"" data-reactid=""9"" itemprop=""name"">Carol Gaszcz</div></div>",The Block
Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto," In a recent interview on London Real, the Bitcoin and open blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos talked about the wrong type of people entering the digital asset economy, and why many end up staying for different reasons other than price. On the topic of the many hype-based cryptocurrency projects we see today, Antonopoulos said that the industry sometimes attracts the wrong type of crowd into the ecosystem. “It attracts scammers, opportunists, pump and dumpers, and pyramid schemes, and the ICO market enabled a lot of those people to make their own coins.” Andreas said that one of the reasons the ICO craze happened was because Ethereum made it easy for people to build a scalable, secure, transferable, and censorship-resistant blockchain “just by writing 20 lines of code”. But the Mastering Ethereum author said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains “to build platforms to do massive pump and dumps” instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance. However, he did mention that in the long run, “if you can fund start-ups with an international pool of investors, that can change the investment fields”. FOMO is in the air. Newbies are joining the cryptocurrency space and falling prey to scammers.  Please educate your friends and family:– Promises of profit are 100% ponzi– Request to ""recruit"", ""affiliate"" etc are 100% pyramid schemes– ICO/IEO are 99.99% pump-and-dump — Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) June 20, 2019  Regarding the parabolic rises and falls of many crypto assets, Andreas said that “nothing goes exponential without going down”, and that Bitcoin has done this eight times already as “that’s how it grows”. “The reason it grows like this is that there isn’t much in terms of short pressure to hold it down,” he said. “If you’ve got something that has limited supply and you suddenly have a speculative mania that blows up, it will continue to go up in a straight line, which only further fuels the mania. “Until it reaches a point where there simply isn’t anybody else who feels just as enthusiastic and it pauses for a second, the panic just drives [the price] down.” Andreas said that there’s “no difference between speculators and investors” and that they’re just speculating with a different risk profile, with some of them doing so “with very little research and information”. He said that the reason this is bad is that “a lot of good, innocent, and slightly naive people lost a lot of money” and had their lives destroyed because of this. This has a negative effect “as it changes the community” and “causes damage to the community”. “You have a lot of drama that comes up when there’s money on the table – people’s personalities change.” He said that people start taking shortcuts and their ethics become compromised – “power corrupts, money corrupts”. Andreas said that the majority of people first got involved in crypto most likely “because they heard that it’s some kind of investment opportunity”. He made the case that even though many of these people may have first entered the space “because of speculation and mania”, the people who were only motivated by price left during the 2018 crash, with those who stayed “finding other motivations”. He claimed some of the reasons why people stay is because they like the community, they understand the technology, and they may even be “driven by the political implications”. To those people, Andreas said: “Welcome, you may have come because you want to get rich – that’s okay. Now let me tell you about why you should stay because of the technology even after the price crashes.”   The post Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto appeared first on Coin Rivet.","<div class=""author Mb(4px) D(ib) Mend(4px)"" data-reactid=""8"" itemprop=""author creator"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""><div class=""author-name Lh(18px) Td(n) Fw(b) Fz(12px) C(#000)"" data-reactid=""9"" itemprop=""name"">Nawaz Sulemanji</div></div>",Coin Rivet
"KuCoin launches derivatives trading platform KuMEX, promises up to 20x leverage"," Count this as the latest attempt by a cryptocurrency exchange to take a piece of the perpetual swap pie. IDG-backed KuCoin has announced the beta launch of its derivatives trading platform, KuMEX. To start, the new platform will offer trading of its so-called Bitcoin Perpetual Contract (XBTUSDM).  KuCoin is the latest cryptocurrency exchange to announce its intention to gatecrash the market for cryptocurrency derivatives, a space currently dominated by behemoth BitMEX. Houbi, Binance, and Bitfinex have recently launched or announced the impending launch of their own platforms to trade perpetual swaps, a synthetic way to bet on cryptocurrencies.  As part of its attempt to lure traders to the new venue, KuMEX will offer rebates to certain traders. “At the same time, KuMEX offers a negative fee for Makers at a rate of -0.025% with a certain amount of fixed commission, encouraging users to provide liquidity to the platform through making the market and earning some commission as an incentive,” the press release reads. Furthermore, the platform uses Bitcoin Spot Index that volume-weights the price of bitcoin in six major exchanges—Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, Liquid and Bittrex. According to the press release, by using figures from more exchanges, KuMEX hopes to achieve a more “fair and rigorous” bitcoin index price. Meanwhile, rival BitMEX prices its swaps based on data from a pool of three exchanges.  KuCoin also announced a trading competition, with a reward of 10,000 KCS for users with top scores in their return rate ranking.","<div class=""author Mb(4px) D(ib) Mend(4px)"" data-reactid=""8"" itemprop=""author creator"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""><div class=""author-name Lh(18px) Td(n) Fw(b) Fz(12px) C(#000)"" data-reactid=""9"" itemprop=""name"">Carol Gaszcz</div></div>",The Block
The Crypto Week – Bitcoin Leads the Way in a Mixed Week for the Majors," While the Bitcoin bulls continued to maintain control, its been another mixed week for the rest of the pack. Bitcoin rose by 2.56% on Saturday. Reversing a 1.42% fall from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,281. On the day, a bullish start to the morning saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,961 to a morning high $11,594 before easing back. The early rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major resistance level at $11,378. Following a relatively range-bound late morning, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $11,720. Falling short of the second major resistance level at $11,753, slid back through the 23.6% FIB to a 2nd half of a day low $11,066. For the bulls, steering clear of sub-$11,000 levels was key late in the day, supporting a move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,280 levels. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 4.45%, which was also supported by 2.29% and 10.09% gains from Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed start to the weekend. Joining Bitcoin in the green for the day were Ripple’s XRP, which led the way with a 3.08% rally. Bitcoin Cash ABC and EOS also ended the day in the green, with gains of 1.59% and 0.19% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.2%), Litecoin (-0.18%), Binance Coin (-0.15%) and Ethereum (-0.09%) saw red on the day, while Tron ended the day flat. For the current week, Bitcoin led the way with its 4.45%, Monday through Saturday. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.7%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+2.33%), and Binance Coin (+2.04%) also saw solid gains. Tron’s TRX and EOS were also in the green with 1.26% and 0.05% gains respectively. Bucking the trend on the week were Litecoin and Ethereum, which were down by 3.1% and by 0.87% respectively. Another choppy week saw the total crypto market cap recover from a Tuesday current week low $288.64bn to a current week high $337.76bn. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $320.33bn. 24-hour trading volumes were on the slide, however. Falling back from $99bn levels on Wednesday, 24-hour trading volumes stood at $62.72bn at the time of writing. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.55% to $11,219. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,276 to a low $11,111 before finding support. Whilst steering clear of the major support and resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, Litecoin recovered from early losses to move into the green, up by 0.06% at the time of writing. Joining Litecoin in the green were EOS (+0.54%), Ethereum (+0.18%) and Binance Coin (+0.02%). Bitcoin Cash ABC joined Bitcoin in the red with a -1.64%, while Bitcoin Cash SV was flat. Bitcoin would need to break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 to $11,320 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $11,680.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $11,720 would likely limit any upside. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,320 levels could see Bitcoin slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $11,111 would bring the first major support level at $10,921.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,900 levels on the day.

The Top 5 cryptocurrencies latest price," Today the price of Bitcoin is US$$11,158.25; Ethereum is US$290.43; XRP is US$0.389770; Bitcoin Cash is US$401.86 and Litecoin is US$119.90. These are the Top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. The top 5 cryptocurrencies are the biggest and most significant cryptocurrencies and constitute the top half of The Top 10 Cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. In August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are. The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without “relying on trust”. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number “0” (or the “genesis block”) which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) developed by the Ripple company. It is also referred to as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol. It can trace its roots to 2004 when a web developer called Ryan Fugger had the idea to create a monetary system that was decentralised and could effectively allow individuals to create their own money. Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on 30th July 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a white paper in 2013 describing Ethereum. Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn’t get buy-in to his proposal. Bitcoin Cash was born out of the idea of making Bitcoin more practical for small, day-to-day payments. In May 2017, Bitcoin payments took about four days unless a fee was paid, which was proportionately too large for small transactions. A change to the code was implemented and Bitcoin Cash was born on 1st August 2017. Litecoin was released in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee. It was a fork of Bitcoin with the main difference being a smaller block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, and a different script-based algorithm.

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 08/07/19," Bitcoin closed out the week in positive territory, resuming what has been a particularly bullish run since January. Year-to-date Bitcoin has seen just 8 weekly losses, 2 of which came in June. On Sunday, Bitcoin rose by 1.85%, following on from a 2.56% gain on Saturday, to end the day at $11,485. It was a relatively range-bound first half of the day. Bitcoin eased back to a mid-morning intraday low $11,110 before recovering to a late morning high $11,375. The late morning rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 that provided much-needed support through the morning. Falling back from $11,400 levels struck in the middle of the day, Bitcoin slipped through the 23.6% FIB to $11,150 levels before finding support. Bitcoin bounced back to a late intraday high $11,620 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin came up short of the first major resistance level at $11,680.33. For the week, the weekend gains delivered a 6.34% rise for the week ending 7th July. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was green across the board for majors on Sunday. Leading the way on the day were Tron’s TRX and Ethereum, which saw gains of 8.94% and 6.52% respectively. EOS also outperformed Bitcoin on the day, rising by 3.28%. The rest of the pack saw more modest gains. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+1.79%), Ripple’s XRP (+1.81%), Binance Coin (+1.91%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.96%) stood alongside Bitcoin on the day. Litecoin saw the most modest gain of the day, however, rising by 1.71%. For the week, Tron’s TRX led the way, rallying by 10.06% to cement its position in the number 10 spot by market cap. Bucking the trend in the week was Litecoin, which fell by 1.52%. Bitcoin’s dominance held onto 62% levels, having peaked at 63% levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.1%. The total crypto market cap rose from $313.57bn to a high $337.76bn on Thursday before easing back to $330bn levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.39% to $11,440. Moves at the start of the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,547 to a low $11,413. Bitcoin steered clear of the major support and resistance levels early on. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Tron’s TRX bucked the trend early, rising by 0.49% and by 0.29% respectively. The rest of the pack were in the red, with Bitcoin Cash SV leading the way down with a 1.47% loss. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,400 levels to make a move later in the day. A move through the morning high to $11,600 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,700 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Sunday’s high $11,620 and the first major resistance level will likely limit any upside. Failure to hold onto $11,400 levels could see Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. A pullback to $11,200 levels would bring the first major support level at $11,190 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 support levels on the day.

Coinsquare buys majority stake in Just Cash in bid to make world’s ATMs crypto-friendly," Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinsquare is making a bid to make digital assets more accessible.  Coinsquare has announced it has made a controlling investment in software provider Just Cash, whose tech will allow any ATM to sell cryptocurrency. The software does not disrupt the ATM network, no hardware changes are required and there are no additional costs to the operator. Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond believes crypto-friendly ATMs are key to making digital assets accessible to the masses.  “Right now, there is a lack of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption because most people are intimidated by the process to acquire it,” said Diamond. “By using the millions of existing ATMs around the world, we can now bridge the gap and give new users the easiest and most familiar experience to purchase cryptocurrency.”","<div class=""author Mb(4px) D(ib) Mend(4px)"" data-reactid=""8"" itemprop=""author creator"" itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.org/Person""><div class=""author-name Lh(18px) Td(n) Fw(b) Fz(12px) C(#000)"" data-reactid=""9"" itemprop=""name"">Carol Gaszcz</div></div>",The Block
Why the Fed should oversee Facebook’s Libra," Facebook (FB) Mark Zuckerberg’s recent announcement of ambitious plans to launch a new, global cryptocurrency called Libra has been met with understandable alarm, particularly among regulators and consumer advocates. Much of the controversy has centered around antitrust issues, consumer privacy, and the ability of crooks to anonymously use the system for illicit purposes. Those are all legitimate concerns, but to my mind, the biggest risks are financial, both to users of Libra and the financial system as a whole. Those risks include the possibility of bank runs, credit disruptions, or consumer losses arising from foreign currency risks or financial mismanagement of the Libra reserve. The best way to understand these risks is to follow the money. Let’s start with the process of buying and redeeming Libra. Most cryptocurrencies, including the granddaddy of them all, Bitcoin, have failed to gain widespread acceptance as a method of payment because of their volatility. Zuckerberg hopes to avoid this problem by backing Libra with a reserve of stable world currencies, including the dollar, Euro, and Swiss franc. So you can buy Libra with pretty much any fiat currency — a U.S. dollar, Brazilian Real, Mongolian Tugrik, Indian Rupee — but the amount of Libra you receive will depend on the exchange rate between your currency and the basket of currencies in the reserve at the time of purchase. When you want to redeem your Libra back into your fiat currency, you may get more. But you may also get a lot less, particularly in developing countries with unstable currencies. It will depend on the exchange rate at the time of redemption. Let’s say you still want to buy this hip new digital coin, regardless of the foreign exchange risk. Where do you get the money? For citizens in the U.S. and other developed countries, the money will probably come from your bank account. It’s not going to hurt the banking system if you withdraw a few hundred a month for Libra transactions. But what if everyone decides they want to replace their bank accounts with Libra? After all, this would be a great way to avoid checking account fees. Retailers will love Libra as a way to avoid paying network fees on debit and credit card transactions. All of a sudden, that giant sucking sound is money coming out of the banks and into Libra’s kitty. You may think, “Fine. Let’s stick it to the banks. Look what they did to the economy in 2008.” But most of that money you withdraw from the banks is money they will no longer have to lend to the economy. So as Libra captures your cash, banks have less to make loans. With a run on the banks, we also get a credit contraction. Now Libra has your money (not the banks) and you have your digital coins. What will Libra do with your money? Libra’s white paper says your digital coin is safe because it will be backed by a basket of the most stable world currencies. But it’s not as if Libra will be purchasing paper money in each of these currencies and piling them in a bank vault. What this really means is that Libra will be taking your money and investing it in instruments denominated in those currencies. The return on these investments is how Facebook and other Libra founders will make money. Thus they will have incentives to invest in instruments that will maximize those returns, which may or may not maintain the stable value Libra’s founders are promising. The white paper promises to invest in low volatility assets such as bank deposits and short-term government securities, using “investment grade” financial institutions as custodians. (Reminder: Lehman Bros had an “A” rating from Standard and Poor’s before its collapse in 2008.) But there is no regulatory body to ensure that it does so, nor to require that Libra’s sponsors put up any of their own capital or reserves to backstop those investments if they go sour. In essence, Libra proposes the failed business model used by money market funds prior to the financial crisis. It wants you to buy Libra on the promise that the coin will maintain stable value, but there will be no regulatory oversight of what Libra actually does with your money and no capital and liquidity requirements that you would typically find with a bank. That structure proved disastrous during the 2008 crisis, when the Reserve Fund, a money market fund that heavily invested in Lehman Bros debt, “broke the buck” and prompted widespread runs on other money market funds. Even if Libra keeps its promise to put your money only in relatively safe bank deposits and government securities, we still have a problem. If the money comes out of banks (where it supports private sector lending) and goes into government securities, we would see a massive re-allocation of resources from the private to the public sectors. If you believe (as do I) that the market is generally a better allocator of economic resources than the government, this re-allocation will serve as a drag on economic growth. Libra says it will also put your money into bank deposits. Bank accounts have the advantage of maintaining stable value. Your bank account balance doesn’t fluctuate as would a securities investment. And perhaps this helps with our bank run problem. You take money out of your bank to buy Libra. Libra puts yours and other users’ money into other banks, which will presumably use it to make loans. But banks do fail, and depositors take losses on their uninsured deposits. So while Libra is saying it’s offering a better alternative to banks because it won’t be taking risk by lending out your money the way banks do, it will be putting at least some of your money right back into banks of its choosing. When you withdrew money from your bank to buy Libra, you probably had less than $250,000 in your account, meaning it was fully protected by the FDIC. But Libra’s founders hope to have a global reserve of hundreds of billions of dollars. Even if they spread the funds among multiple banks, at those levels, the lion’s share will likely be uninsured. Anyone who has followed my writings on blockchain knows that I’m enthusiastic about the use of distributed ledger technology to remove frictions in the payments system. So I don’t mean to sound too negative. The problem is, so long as cryptocurrencies have to rely on fiat currencies to maintain stable value, they will be exposed to the same kinds of risks embedded in the banking systems that support those currencies. I believe most of these risks can be addressed with thoughtful regulation. But before Mark Zuckenberg or anyone else tries to create his own global currency, we need to settle on an adequate regulatory framework to govern them. It would make sense for Congress to give the Federal Reserve Board lead authority for overseeing Libra, given its responsibility to conduct monetary policy and oversee an effective and efficient payments system. It is also an experienced financial supervisor, well-equipped to develop capital and liquidity requirements for Libra and other such ventures. In exercising that authority, the Fed could build on the pioneering work of the New York Department of Financial Services which currently regulates two trust companies which have successfully launched stable coins backed by the U.S. dollar. (Disclosure. I serve on the board of one of those trusts, Paxos.) Technology has the potential to dramatically change how the world pays for things in the future. Whether that transition is beneficial to consumers and businesses or financially disruptive will depend on whether regulators can stay ahead of this potentially rapid transformation. It’s open to question whether Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are the right stewards for a new global cryptocurrency. But by firing this warning shot to government policy makers that such a change is coming and potentially coming soon, they have done a public service.

"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 08/07/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC rose by 1.79% on Sunday. Following on from a 1.59% gain on Saturday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the week up 3.85% to $411.6 Bearish through most of the day, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell from a morning high $406.63 to a late afternoon intraday low $397.25. The reversal saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall through the first major support level at $399.55 before finding support. A late afternoon rally saw Bitcoin Cash ABC strike an intraday high $414.93 before easing back to sub-$411 levels. Bitcoin Cash ABC fell short of the first major resistance level at $415.68 and the 23.6% FIB of $418 on the day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was down by 0.75% to $408.50. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall from a morning high $413.08 to a low $408.50. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, hold onto $408 levels would support a move back through the morning high to $415 levels. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from $410 levels on the day. A broad-based crypto rebound would bring the 23.6% FIB of $418 and first major resistance level at $418.6 into play. Failure to hold onto $408 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC test the first major support level at $400.92. In the event of an extended crypto market sell-off, Bitcoin Cash ABC could visit sub-$400 levels before any recovery. The second major support level at $390.25 should limit the downside in the event of a major reversal. Litecoin rose by 1.71% on Sunday. Reversing a 0.18% fall from Saturday, Litecoin ended the week down 1.52% at $120.18. Range-bound through much of the day, Litecoin rose from an early morning low $117.43 to a late morning high $119.84. Steering clear of the major support and resistance levels through the morning, Litecoin slid to a late afternoon intraday low $117.0. The reversal saw Litecoin test support at the 23.6% FIB of $117 before striking an intraday high $121.39. Litecoin broke through the first major resistance level at $121.26 before falling back to $120 levels. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 0.31% to $119.81. Tracking the broader market, Litecoin fell from a morning high $120.71 to a low $119.41 before finding support. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold above $119.5 levels would support another run at $121 levels. Litecoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $120.71. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level at $122.05 would likely come into play. Failure to hold above $119.5 levels could see Litecoin test the first major support level at $117.66. In the event of an extended reversal through the day, Litecoin would likely fall through the 23.6% FIB of $117 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Litecoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $115.13. Ripple’s XRP rose by 1.88% on Sunday. Following on from 3.08% gain from Saturday, Ripple’s XRP ended the week up 1.15% to $0.39885. Bullish through the morning, Ripple’s XRP rose from an early intraday low $0.38820 to a late morning intraday high $0.40172.

Ripple’s XRP left the major support levels untested on the day. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 0.69% to $0.39610. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from a morning high $0.39952 to a low $0.39515. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold onto $0.3960 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $0.4043. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high $0.39952. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP would likely come up short of $0.41 levels. The second major resistance level at $0.4098 would cap any upside on the day. Failure to hold onto $0.3960 levels could see Ripple’s XRP slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low to $0.3930 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.3908 into play. Barring an extended crypto market sell-off, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of the second major support level at $0.3827.

Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date?," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook’s first foray into cryptocurrency is coming – first dubbed ‘Facebook Coin’, then ‘Global Coin’, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It’s at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle – the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don’t have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: “The Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.” So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it’s a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn’t allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves. Is there a darker side to Libra?

Bitcoin Tech Analysis – Recap and Mid-Day Review – 04/07/19," Bitcoin rallied by 10.09% on Wednesday. Following on from a 2.29% gain on Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,983. A bullish start to the day set the tone, with Bitcoin on the move from the start of the day. Bitcoin rallied from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. The moves through the early hours saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and the first major resistance level at $11,762.87. A pullback to sub-$11,000 levels by late morning saw Bitcoin steer clear of the first major support level at $10,087.13 before a late rally. The late rally saw Bitcoin break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275, first major resistance level at $11,323.93, and second major resistance level at $11,762.87 to hit an intraday high $12,025. Resistance at $12,000 limited the upside on the day. The Bitcoin rally led to Bitcoin’s dominance rising back to 62% levels. Bitcoin’s market cap jumped to a Wednesday high $213.5bn before easing back. Bitcoin ultimately provided support to the broader crypto market, leading the majors into positive territory on the day. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December’s swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin continued to find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Wednesday’s rally was another day of correlation with the more mature markets. The rally kicked in well ahead of economic data out of the U.S, however. Weak U.S stats continued to support the FED’s projected rate cut later in the day year. While the cheaper cost of funds is a boon for riskier assets, the current interest rate environment continues to be supportive. A negative for Bitcoin and the broader market continues to be the prospect of a material shift in the regulatory landscape. There’s also the pending SEC decisions on the Bitcoin ETFs to consider. The recent volatility across the broader market has come at the wrong time for those hoping for Bitcoin ETFs to be approved. The good news, however, is the fact that there have been no headline cases of exchanges being hacked… Another piece of good news is the fact that the planned launch of Facebook’s Libra has done no damage just yet… At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.63% to $11,787. In the early part of the day, Bitcoin rose to a start of a day high $12,065 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,379.33, Bitcoin fell back to a late morning low $11,503. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33, Bitcoin moved back through to $11,700 levels. For the Bitcoin bulls, $12,000 looks to be the line in the sand. A hold onto $11,700 levels through the early afternoon would support a move back through to $11,900 levels. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $12,065. In the event of a breakout, the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 would come into play before any pullback. Failure to hold onto $11,700 levels could see Bitcoin slide back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Barring an extended sell-off through the afternoon, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit the downside. In the event of a sell-off, expect a return to sub-$11,000 levels before finding support.
