The Crypto Daily ‚Äì The Movers and Shakers 05/07/19," Bitcoin led the way on Thursday, but this time for all the wrong reasons‚Ä¶ Bitcoin tumbled by 6.85% on Thursday. Partially reversing Wednesday‚Äôs 10.09% rally to end the day at $11,162.5. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning intraday high $12,065 to a late morning low $11,503. The moves through the morning saw Bitcoin leave the major support and resistance levels untested. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin recovered to an afternoon high $11,922 before taking a hit in the final hour. The final hour sell-off saw Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33. For Bitcoin, the only positive of the day was the avoidance of sub-$11,000 levels for the first time since 29th June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was red for all but one of the top 10 cryptos on Thursday. Bucking the trend on the day was Binance Coin, which rose by 1.23%. It was deep red for the rest of the pack. Ethereum was close behind Bitcoin, sliding by 6.29%, with EOS (-5.62%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-5%) also seeing heavy losses. Things were not much better for Ripple‚Äôs XRP and Tron, which fell by 4.47% and 4.7% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin saw more modest losses on the day. While Bitcoin Cash SV fell by 3.44%, Litecoin fell by just 1.8%. The Bitcoin sell-off on the day led to Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance pulling back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance stood at 62.5% The total crypto market cap fell from a high $338.45bn to end the day at $319.29bn on Thursday, weighed by Bitcoin‚Äôs pullback. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.35% to $11,201. Moves in the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $11,005 to a high $11,287 before easing back. Whilst leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 before the pullback. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.71%), EOS (+0.23%) and Ethereum (+0.25%) also found early support. Litecoin and Binance Coin struggled at the start, with losses of 0.56% and 0.6% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to $11,430 levels to support a reversal of Thursday‚Äôs losses. A move through to $11,500 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,800 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning‚Äôs high $11,287. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could touch $12,000 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,430 levels could see Bitcoin take another hit. A fall through the morning low $11,005 would bring the first major support level at $10,790 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $10,417.5 on the day.

The top 5 cryptocurrencies are the biggest and most significant cryptocurrencies and constitute the top half of The Top 10 Cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. In August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called ‚ÄúBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System‚Äù. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are. The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without ‚Äúrelying on trust‚Äù. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number ‚Äú0‚Äù (or the ‚Äúgenesis block‚Äù) which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) developed by the Ripple company. It is also referred to as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol. It can trace its roots to 2004 when a web developer called Ryan Fugger had the idea to create a monetary system that was decentralised and could effectively allow individuals to create their own money. Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on 30th July 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a white paper in 2013 describing Ethereum. Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn‚Äôt get buy-in to his proposal. Bitcoin Cash was born out of the idea of making Bitcoin more practical for small, day-to-day payments. In May 2017, Bitcoin payments took about four days unless a fee was paid, which was proportionately too large for small transactions. A change to the code was implemented and Bitcoin Cash was born on 1st August 2017. Litecoin was released in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee. It was a fork of Bitcoin with the main difference being a smaller block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, and a different script-based algorithm.

"Bitcoin may soon go parabolic over $12,000 again"," Bitcoin is once more looking bullish as the world‚Äôs biggest decentralised asset has found a new influx of buying support to rally close to 20% in price since the start of July. On a backdrop of global turmoils driven by a narrative of trade tensions, a breakout in the gold and commodities markets, and even US President Donald Trump calling out China and Europe specifically for currency manipulation, could this be the perfect storm for Bitcoin to break past resistance and head upwards to fresh 2019 highs? China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games ‚Äì as they have for many years! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019  Long-time Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos has reminded the community that governments may soon try and ‚Äúblame crypto for the currency war‚Äù, but ‚Äúthe race to the bottom‚Äù for state-backed fiat currencies has little to do with the disruptive asset class. Towards the end of last week, Bitcoin continued to grind to defend its five-figure valuation. Unlike other downward price movements that we have seen of late, Bitcoin‚Äôs move down did not include any large-scale sell-offs, but instead a series of mini-dumps taking the price down from $12,000 to $10,000. Since this local bottom was hit, we have seen volumes pick up and buyers come back into the market to drive the price back up to the same level where the ‚Äòcontrolled‚Äô sell-off began. If Bitcoin can now penetrate through the $12,000-$12,400 level of resistance, the move back up to $14,000 and beyond may be quicker than its initial parabolic rise in late June. If the digitally-scarce asset does decide to rally up from this point, the odds of ever seeing an exchange-traded price of under $10,000 will decrease exponentially as fast as any potential move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency. That is why we are all here.  Anything short of this becomes much less interesting. ‚Äî Pomp üå™ (@APompliano) July 4, 2019  ¬† The popular Bitcoin analyst Anthony ‚ÄúPomp‚Äù Pompliano recently outlined his $100,000 Bitcoin target for the end of 2021, but the chances are that if we do see all-time highs broken sooner rather than later, a six-figure valuation for Bitcoin may become a reality quicker than even the most bullish commentators in the space would ever expect.

Is Libra crypto‚Äôs best gateway drug to date?," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook‚Äôs first foray into cryptocurrency is coming ‚Äì first dubbed ‚ÄòFacebook Coin‚Äô, then ‚ÄòGlobal Coin‚Äô, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It‚Äôs at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle ‚Äì the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don‚Äôt have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: ‚ÄúThe Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.‚Äù So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it‚Äôs a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn‚Äôt allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves. Is there a darker side to Libra? The post Is Libra crypto‚Äôs best gateway drug to date? appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Chris Coney,Coin Rivet,2019-07-03T15:00:56.000Z
Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto," In a recent interview on London Real, the Bitcoin and open blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos talked about the wrong type of people entering the digital asset economy, and why many end up staying for different reasons other than price. On the topic of the many hype-based cryptocurrency projects we see today, Antonopoulos said that the industry sometimes attracts the wrong type of crowd into the ecosystem. ‚ÄúIt attracts scammers, opportunists, pump and dumpers, and pyramid schemes, and the ICO market enabled a lot of those people to make their own coins.‚Äù Andreas said that one of the reasons the ICO craze happened was because Ethereum made it easy for people to build a scalable, secure, transferable, and censorship-resistant blockchain ‚Äújust by writing 20 lines of code‚Äù. But the Mastering Ethereum author said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains ‚Äúto build platforms to do massive pump and dumps‚Äù instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance. However, he did mention that in the long run, ‚Äúif you can fund start-ups with an international pool of investors, that can change the investment fields‚Äù. FOMO is in the air. Newbies are joining the cryptocurrency space and falling prey to scammers.  Please educate your friends and family:‚Äì Promises of profit are 100% ponzi‚Äì Request to ""recruit"", ""affiliate"" etc are 100% pyramid schemes‚Äì ICO/IEO are 99.99% pump-and-dump ‚Äî Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) June 20, 2019  Regarding the parabolic rises and falls of many crypto assets, Andreas said that ‚Äúnothing goes exponential without going down‚Äù, and that Bitcoin has done this eight times already as ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how it grows‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe reason it grows like this is that there isn‚Äôt much in terms of short pressure to hold it down,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve got something that has limited supply and you suddenly have a speculative mania that blows up, it will continue to go up in a straight line, which only further fuels the mania. ‚ÄúUntil it reaches a point where there simply isn‚Äôt anybody else who feels just as enthusiastic and it pauses for a second, the panic just drives [the price] down.‚Äù Andreas said that there‚Äôs ‚Äúno difference between speculators and investors‚Äù and that they‚Äôre just speculating with a different risk profile, with some of them doing so ‚Äúwith very little research and information‚Äù. He said that the reason this is bad is that ‚Äúa lot of good, innocent, and slightly naive people lost a lot of money‚Äù and had their lives destroyed because of this. This has a negative effect ‚Äúas it changes the community‚Äù and ‚Äúcauses damage to the community‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou have a lot of drama that comes up when there‚Äôs money on the table ‚Äì people‚Äôs personalities change.‚Äù He said that people start taking shortcuts and their ethics become compromised ‚Äì ‚Äúpower corrupts, money corrupts‚Äù. Andreas said that the majority of people first got involved in crypto most likely ‚Äúbecause they heard that it‚Äôs some kind of investment opportunity‚Äù. He made the case that even though many of these people may have first entered the space ‚Äúbecause of speculation and mania‚Äù, the people who were only motivated by price left during the 2018 crash, with those who stayed ‚Äúfinding other motivations‚Äù. He claimed some of the reasons why people stay is because they like the community, they understand the technology, and they may even be ‚Äúdriven by the political implications‚Äù. To those people, Andreas said: ‚ÄúWelcome, you may have come because you want to get rich ‚Äì that‚Äôs okay. Now let me tell you about why you should stay because of the technology even after the price crashes.‚Äù   The post Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Nawaz Sulemanji,Coin Rivet,2019-07-03T13:00:11.000Z
Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.¬† The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of ‚Äúdigital payment tokens‚Äù in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, ‚Äúwill not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.‚Äù The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: ‚Äú(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.‚Äù  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. ‚ÄúA digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,‚Äù it said.",Yogita Khatri,The Block,2019-07-08T07:12:34.000Z
The Crypto Daily ‚Äì The Movers and Shakers 08/07/19," Bitcoin closed out the week in positive territory, resuming what has been a particularly bullish run since January. Year-to-date Bitcoin has seen just 8 weekly losses, 2 of which came in June. On Sunday, Bitcoin rose by 1.85%, following on from a 2.56% gain on Saturday, to end the day at $11,485. It was a relatively range-bound first half of the day. Bitcoin eased back to a mid-morning intraday low $11,110 before recovering to a late morning high $11,375. The late morning rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 that provided much-needed support through the morning. Falling back from $11,400 levels struck in the middle of the day, Bitcoin slipped through the 23.6% FIB to $11,150 levels before finding support. Bitcoin bounced back to a late intraday high $11,620 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin came up short of the first major resistance level at $11,680.33. For the week, the weekend gains delivered a 6.34% rise for the week ending 7th July. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was green across the board for majors on Sunday. Leading the way on the day were Tron‚Äôs TRX and Ethereum, which saw gains of 8.94% and 6.52% respectively. EOS also outperformed Bitcoin on the day, rising by 3.28%. The rest of the pack saw more modest gains. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+1.79%), Ripple‚Äôs XRP (+1.81%), Binance Coin (+1.91%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.96%) stood alongside Bitcoin on the day. Litecoin saw the most modest gain of the day, however, rising by 1.71%. For the week, Tron‚Äôs TRX led the way, rallying by 10.06% to cement its position in the number 10 spot by market cap. Bucking the trend in the week was Litecoin, which fell by 1.52%. Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance held onto 62% levels, having peaked at 63% levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance stood at 62.1%. The total crypto market cap rose from $313.57bn to a high $337.76bn on Thursday before easing back to $330bn levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.39% to $11,440. Moves at the start of the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,547 to a low $11,413. Bitcoin steered clear of the major support and resistance levels early on. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Tron‚Äôs TRX bucked the trend early, rising by 0.49% and by 0.29% respectively. The rest of the pack were in the red, with Bitcoin Cash SV leading the way down with a 1.47% loss. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,400 levels to make a move later in the day. A move through the morning high to $11,600 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,700 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Sunday‚Äôs high $11,620 and the first major resistance level will likely limit any upside. Failure to hold onto $11,400 levels could see Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. A pullback to $11,200 levels would bring the first major support level at $11,190 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 support levels on the day.

Why the Fed should oversee Facebook‚Äôs Libra," Facebook (FB) Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs recent announcement of ambitious plans to launch a¬†new, global cryptocurrency called Libra¬†has been met with understandable alarm, particularly among regulators and consumer advocates. Much of the controversy has centered around antitrust issues, consumer privacy, and the ability of crooks to anonymously use the system for illicit purposes. Those are all legitimate concerns, but to my mind, the biggest risks are financial, both to users of Libra and the financial system as a whole. Those risks include the possibility of bank runs, credit disruptions, or consumer losses arising from foreign currency risks or financial mismanagement of the Libra reserve. The best way to understand these risks is to follow the money. Let‚Äôs start with the process of buying and redeeming Libra. Most cryptocurrencies, including the granddaddy of them all, Bitcoin, have failed to gain widespread acceptance as a method of payment because of their volatility. Zuckerberg hopes to avoid this problem by backing Libra with a reserve of stable world currencies, including the dollar, Euro, and Swiss franc. So you can buy Libra with pretty much any fiat currency ‚Äî a U.S. dollar, Brazilian Real, Mongolian Tugrik, Indian Rupee ‚Äî but the amount of Libra you receive will depend on the exchange rate between your currency and the basket of currencies in the reserve at the time of purchase. When you want to redeem your Libra back into your fiat currency, you may get more. But you may also get a lot less, particularly in developing countries with unstable currencies. It will depend on the exchange rate at the time of redemption. Let‚Äôs say you still want to buy this hip new digital coin, regardless of the foreign exchange risk. Where do you get the money? For citizens in the U.S. and other developed countries, the money will probably come from your bank account. It‚Äôs not going to hurt the banking system if you withdraw a few hundred a month for Libra transactions. But what if everyone decides they want to replace their bank accounts with Libra? After all, this would be a great way to avoid checking account fees. Retailers will love Libra as a way to avoid paying network fees on debit and credit card transactions. All of a sudden, that giant sucking sound is money coming out of the banks and into Libra‚Äôs kitty. You may think, ‚ÄúFine. Let‚Äôs stick it to the banks. Look what they did to the economy in 2008.‚Äù But most of that money you withdraw from the banks is money they will no longer have to lend to the economy. So as Libra captures your cash, banks have less to make loans. With a run on the banks, we also get a credit contraction. Now Libra has your money (not the banks) and you have your digital coins. What will Libra do with your money?¬†Libra‚Äôs white paper¬†says your digital coin is safe because it will be backed by a basket of the most stable world currencies. But it‚Äôs not as if Libra will be purchasing paper money in each of these currencies and piling them in a bank vault. What this really means is that Libra will be taking your money and investing it in instruments denominated in those currencies. The return on these investments is how Facebook and other Libra founders will make money. Thus they will have incentives to invest in instruments that will maximize those returns, which may or may not maintain the stable value Libra‚Äôs founders are promising. The white paper promises to invest in low volatility assets such as bank deposits and short-term government securities, using ‚Äúinvestment grade‚Äù financial institutions as custodians. (Reminder: Lehman Bros had an ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating from Standard and Poor‚Äôs before its collapse in 2008.) But there is no regulatory body to ensure that it does so, nor to require that Libra‚Äôs sponsors put up any of their own capital or reserves to backstop those investments if they go sour. In essence, Libra proposes the failed business model used by money market funds prior to the financial crisis. It wants you to buy Libra on the promise that the coin will maintain stable value, but there will be no regulatory oversight of what Libra actually does with your money and no capital and liquidity requirements that you would typically find with a bank. That structure proved disastrous during the 2008 crisis, when the Reserve Fund, a money market fund that heavily invested in Lehman Bros debt, ‚Äúbroke the buck‚Äù and prompted widespread runs on other money market funds. Even if Libra keeps its promise to put your money only in relatively safe bank deposits and government securities, we still have a problem. If the money comes out of banks (where it supports private sector lending) and goes into government securities, we would see a massive re-allocation of resources from the private to the public sectors. If you believe (as do I) that the market is generally a better allocator of economic resources than the government, this re-allocation will serve as a drag on economic growth. Libra says it will also put your money into bank deposits. Bank accounts have the advantage of maintaining stable value. Your bank account balance doesn‚Äôt fluctuate as would a securities investment. And perhaps this helps with our bank run problem. You take money out of your bank to buy Libra. Libra puts yours and other users‚Äô money into other banks, which will presumably use it to make loans. But banks do fail, and depositors take losses on their uninsured deposits. So while Libra is saying it‚Äôs offering a better alternative to banks because it won‚Äôt be taking risk by lending out your money the way banks do, it will be putting at least some of your money right back into banks of its choosing. When you withdrew money from your bank to buy Libra, you probably had less than $250,000 in your account, meaning it was fully protected by the FDIC. But Libra‚Äôs founders hope to have a global reserve of hundreds of billions of dollars. Even if they spread the funds among multiple banks, at those levels, the lion‚Äôs share will likely be uninsured. Anyone who has followed my writings on blockchain knows that I‚Äôm enthusiastic about the use of distributed ledger technology to remove frictions in the payments system. So I don‚Äôt mean to sound too negative. The problem is, so long as cryptocurrencies have to rely on fiat currencies to maintain stable value, they will be exposed to the same kinds of risks embedded in the banking systems that support those currencies. I believe most of these risks can be addressed with thoughtful regulation. But before Mark Zuckenberg or anyone else tries to create his own global currency, we need to settle on an adequate regulatory framework to govern them. It would make sense for Congress to give the Federal Reserve Board lead authority for overseeing Libra, given its responsibility to conduct monetary policy and oversee an effective and efficient payments system. It is also an experienced financial supervisor, well-equipped to develop capital and liquidity requirements for Libra and other such ventures. In exercising that authority, the Fed could build on the pioneering work of the New York Department of Financial Services which currently regulates two trust companies which have successfully launched stable coins backed by the U.S. dollar. (Disclosure. I serve on the board of one of those trusts, Paxos.) Technology has the potential to dramatically change how the world pays for things in the future. Whether that transition is beneficial to consumers and businesses or financially disruptive will depend on whether regulators can stay ahead of this potentially rapid transformation. It‚Äôs open to question whether Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are the right stewards for a new global cryptocurrency. But by firing this warning shot to government policy makers that such a change is coming and potentially coming soon, they have done a public service.

"SEC seeks blockchain data provider to monitor risk, improve compliance, and inform policy"," The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is getting ever more serious about blockchain data. While many of the world's governments and politicians focus on Facebook's recently introduced Libra and data sharing among virtual asset providers, the SEC is seeking more data on public blockchains. The requirements listed by the SEC specific that all data is sourced from hosted notes rather than blockchain explorers. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are mandatory, while Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Zcash, EOS, NEO and XRP data are all specified as desirable. In addition, as new blockchains gain increased prominence, the SEC would require support for them. The SEC is seeking full blockchain data from the genesis block or inception and information about any derivative currencies (tokens) affiliated with these blockchains. The required data format is very specific with normalized fields for each included blockchain sourced from on-node data, in its entirety. The minimum fields specified are ticker symbol; send and receive addresses; transaction hash, timestamp and amounts; unspent send and receive balances; transaction fees; confirmations; block hash; and block height. If possible, the SEC also seeks further metadata and chain metrics such as hashing algorithms, hashing power, mining difficulty and rewards, transactions quantity and size, coin supply and blockchain size. The data is expected to be provided directly by the vendor's own node for each blockchain using a secure, encrypted data feed; synced with the network; and run in a secure, controlled environment. The data must also be presented with means to validate its accuracy and completeness and meet the requirements of financial statement audit testing. The contract length will be for one year, followed by four optional 12 month terms. A technical quote and price quote are both required for application. The SEC's deadline for submission by prospective data vendors is 12pm EST on July 11, 2019.¬†",The Block,None,2019-07-06T12:22:01.000Z
The Crypto Week ‚Äì Bitcoin Leads the Way in a Mixed Week for the Majors," While the Bitcoin bulls continued to maintain control, its been another mixed week for the rest of the pack. Bitcoin rose by 2.56% on Saturday. Reversing a 1.42% fall from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,281. On the day, a bullish start to the morning saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,961 to a morning high $11,594 before easing back. The early rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major resistance level at $11,378. Following a relatively range-bound late morning, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $11,720. Falling short of the second major resistance level at $11,753, slid back through the 23.6% FIB to a 2nd half of a day low $11,066. For the bulls, steering clear of sub-$11,000 levels was key late in the day, supporting a move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,280 levels. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 4.45%, which was also supported by 2.29% and 10.09% gains from Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed start to the weekend. Joining Bitcoin in the green for the day were Ripple‚Äôs XRP, which led the way with a 3.08% rally. Bitcoin Cash ABC and EOS also ended the day in the green, with gains of 1.59% and 0.19% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.2%), Litecoin (-0.18%), Binance Coin (-0.15%) and Ethereum (-0.09%) saw red on the day, while Tron ended the day flat. For the current week, Bitcoin led the way with its 4.45%, Monday through Saturday. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.7%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+2.33%), and Binance Coin (+2.04%) also saw solid gains. Tron‚Äôs TRX and EOS were also in the green with 1.26% and 0.05% gains respectively. Bucking the trend on the week were Litecoin and Ethereum, which were down by 3.1% and by 0.87% respectively. Another choppy week saw the total crypto market cap recover from a Tuesday current week low $288.64bn to a current week high $337.76bn. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $320.33bn. 24-hour trading volumes were on the slide, however. Falling back from $99bn levels on Wednesday, 24-hour trading volumes stood at $62.72bn at the time of writing. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.55% to $11,219. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,276 to a low $11,111 before finding support. Whilst steering clear of the major support and resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, Litecoin recovered from early losses to move into the green, up by 0.06% at the time of writing. Joining Litecoin in the green were EOS (+0.54%), Ethereum (+0.18%) and Binance Coin (+0.02%). Bitcoin Cash ABC joined Bitcoin in the red with a -1.64%, while Bitcoin Cash SV was flat. Bitcoin would need to break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 to $11,320 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $11,680.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday‚Äôs high $11,720 would likely limit any upside. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,320 levels could see Bitcoin slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $11,111 would bring the first major support level at $10,921.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,900 levels on the day.

Latest Bitcoin price and analysis (BTC to USD)," At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading just above $11,450 after price crashed close to 23% from $13,800 to $10,500 during the previous week. It seems the hypothesis that weekends are good for Bitcoin may not always be true, even though the price is now higher than it was one week ago as BTC consolidated above the key $11,000 level on Sunday. Will Bitcoin push higher during the week? Or will we see more major retracements back to the $10,000 region? Bitcoin is evolving as expected. Its overall value keeps increasing, and if you look at the volumes profile on the left of the graph above, you‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs plenty of volume keeping BTC above the critical $11,000 level. My prediction that Bitcoin could hit $20,000 by the end of the year could turn into an ‚Äúend of the month‚Äù kind of deal. Assuming the positive trend continues and BTC price continues to rise, we should expect higher volumes coming in at key levels close to $20,000. Although many retail investors will be looking to sell some of their gains when Bitcoin hits all-time highs again, we can expect the price to keep going at least for a few weeks. However, as the market becomes more liquid, we should expect fewer violent swings, so it could take longer for BTC to reach a new high. Let‚Äôs not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we‚Äôve already accomplished that goal ‚Äì not only in shorter time frames but also in daily and weekly ones as well ‚Äì I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past two weeks, volume has gone from $17 billion to $23 billion, consolidating now around $20 billion. Putting all this information together, we‚Äôre now clearly on the right path to reach $15,000 ‚Äì or maybe even $20,000 ‚Äì by the end of 2019. Of course, if you think I might be overreacting to positive news, you can always check what other expert analysts have to say about this recent price movement. Hopefully, the market will continue this positive momentum. Pay attention to retracements back down towards the 200-day EMA to make new entries. Safe trades!

The Crypto Daily ‚Äì The Movers and Shakers 04/07/19," Bitcoin led the way on Wednesday, providing much-needed support to the broader market at the turn of the quarter. Bitcoin rallied by 10.09% on Wednesday. Following on from a 2.29% gain from Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,982. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major resistance level at $11,323.93 before hitting reverse. Bitcoin fell back through the 23.6% FIB to sub-$11,000 levels before bouncing back to $11,500 levels. A relatively choppy afternoon saw Bitcoin find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 before a late in the day rally. The late rally saw Bitcoin rise from an afternoon low $11,038 to a late intraday high $12,025. Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB, first major resistance level at $11,323.93 and second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of green across the crypto-board. Coming in a distant second to Bitcoin was Ethereum, which gained 3.62%. Bitcoin Cash SV (+3.03%), Litecoin (+2.69%), EOS (+2.39%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.25%), Tron (+2.14%) and Binance Coin (+2.10%) also made solid gains on the day. For Stellar‚Äôs Lumen, a modest 1.52% gain on the day saw the gap widen with Tron sitting at the number 10 spot by market cap. The Bitcoin rally on the day led to Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance rising back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance stood at 63.1% The total crypto market cap rose from $315bn levels to $337.4bn on Wednesday, supported by Bitcoin‚Äôs break out. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.08% to $11,852. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to a morning high $12,065 before falling to a morning low $11,808. Bitcoin left the major resistance and support levels untested in the early hours. Elsewhere, Binance Coin bucked the trend at the time of writing, rising by 0.31%. For the rest of the pack, it was back in the red. Leading the way was EOS, which was down by 2.25%. Litecoin (-1.38%), Ethereum (-1.26%) and Tron (-1.21%) were also deep in the red in the early hours. Amongst the cryptos in reverse, Bitcoin Cash SV saw the most modest loss, down by 0.02% at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,800 levels through the morning to support a rebound later in the day. A move through the morning high $12,065 would bring the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high. Failure to hold onto $11,800 levels could see Bitcoin cough up Wednesday‚Äôs gains.

Bitcoin Tech Analysis ‚Äì Recap and Mid-Day Review ‚Äì 04/07/19," Bitcoin rallied by 10.09% on Wednesday. Following on from a 2.29% gain on Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,983. A bullish start to the day set the tone, with Bitcoin on the move from the start of the day. Bitcoin rallied from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. The moves through the early hours saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and the first major resistance level at $11,762.87. A pullback to sub-$11,000 levels by late morning saw Bitcoin steer clear of the first major support level at $10,087.13 before a late rally. The late rally saw Bitcoin break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275, first major resistance level at $11,323.93, and second major resistance level at $11,762.87 to hit an intraday high $12,025. Resistance at $12,000 limited the upside on the day. The Bitcoin rally led to Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance rising back to 62% levels. Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap jumped to a Wednesday high $213.5bn before easing back. Bitcoin ultimately provided support to the broader crypto market, leading the majors into positive territory on the day. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December‚Äôs swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin continued to find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Wednesday‚Äôs rally was another day of correlation with the more mature markets. The rally kicked in well ahead of economic data out of the U.S, however. Weak U.S stats continued to support the FED‚Äôs projected rate cut later in the day year. While the cheaper cost of funds is a boon for riskier assets, the current interest rate environment continues to be supportive. A negative for Bitcoin and the broader market continues to be the prospect of a material shift in the regulatory landscape. There‚Äôs also the pending SEC decisions on the Bitcoin ETFs to consider. The recent volatility across the broader market has come at the wrong time for those hoping for Bitcoin ETFs to be approved. The good news, however, is the fact that there have been no headline cases of exchanges being hacked‚Ä¶ Another piece of good news is the fact that the planned launch of Facebook‚Äôs Libra has done no damage just yet‚Ä¶ At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.63% to $11,787. In the early part of the day, Bitcoin rose to a start of a day high $12,065 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,379.33, Bitcoin fell back to a late morning low $11,503. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33, Bitcoin moved back through to $11,700 levels. For the Bitcoin bulls, $12,000 looks to be the line in the sand. A hold onto $11,700 levels through the early afternoon would support a move back through to $11,900 levels. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning‚Äôs high $12,065. In the event of a breakout, the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 would come into play before any pullback. Failure to hold onto $11,700 levels could see Bitcoin slide back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Barring an extended sell-off through the afternoon, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit the downside. In the event of a sell-off, expect a return to sub-$11,000 levels before finding support.

"Bitcoin Cash ‚Äì ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis ‚Äì 03/07/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC fell by 2.59% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 4.11% gain from Monday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $408.02. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall from an early intraday high $418.87 to a late morning intraday low $383.16. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the 23.6% FIB of $418 and the first major support level at $394.38. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin Cash ABC recovered to $400 levels to limit the loss on the day. In spite of the partial recovery, Bitcoin Cash ABC was unable to move back through the 23.6% FIB‚Ä¶ At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 1.1% to $412.50. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $408.41 to a high $418.0. Whilst falling short of the first major resistance level at $423.54, the 23.6% FIB of $418 continued to limit progress. For the day ahead, Bitcoin Cash ABC would need to steer clear of sub-$410 levels to support another run at the first major resistance level at $423.54. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the 23.6% FIB of $418. An extended crypto rally through the day could see Bitcoin Cash ABC test the second major resistance level at $439.06. Failure to avoid sub-$410 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC slide back through to sub-$400 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, the first major support level at $387.87 should limit any downside on the day. Litecoin slid by 3.26% on Tuesday. Reversing a 0.42% gain from Monday with interest, Litecoin ended the day at $118.59. A particularly bearish morning saw Litecoin slide from an intraday high $123.41 to a mid-morning intraday low $111.2. The reversal saw Litecoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $117 and the first major support level at $114.94. Finding support through the afternoon, Litecoin managed a brief return to $120 levels before easing back. The 23.6% FIB proved to be the resistance line on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 1.63% to $120.52. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a morning low $118.54 to a high $123.16 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested and also held above the 23.6% FIB of $117. For the day ahead, a hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 through the morning would support a bullish day ahead. A move back through the morning high $123.16 would bring the first major resistance level at $124.27 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Litecoin would likely see any upside capped at $126 levels on the day. Failure to hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 could see Litecoin test the first major support level at $112.06 before any recovery. Barring a crypto sell-off later in the day, Litecoin should steer clear of sub-$110 support levels on the day. Ripple‚Äôs XRP fell by 1.98% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 3.4% gain from Monday, Ripple‚Äôs XRP ended the day at $0.39991. Tracking the broader market, Ripple‚Äôs XRP fell from an early intraday high $0.41187 to a late morning intraday low $0.38414. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Ripple‚Äôs XRP fell through the first major support level at $0.3922. Recovery through the afternoon saw Ripple‚Äôs XRP return to $0.4040 levels before sliding back to sub-$0.40 levels. At the time of writing, Ripple‚Äôs XRP was up by 0.74% to $0.40288. Tracking the broader market, Ripple‚Äôs XRP rose from a morning low $0.39989 to a high $0.40711 before easing back. Ripple‚Äôs XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on and also fell short of the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164. For the day ahead, a hold onto $0.40 levels through the morning would support further gains later in the day. A move back through the morning high $0.40711 would bring the first major resistance level at $0.4131 into play. Ripple‚Äôs XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to break through the 23.6 % FIB of $0.4164. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple‚Äôs XRP would likely come up short of $0.42 levels on the day. Failure to move back through the morning high $0.40711 could see Ripple‚Äôs XRP hit reverse.

Making this easy to understand isn‚Äôt easy," Having recently read an article on the BBC website purporting to try and explain the importance of blockchain to the world‚Äôs economy, I was struck by the intellectual muddiness of these waters and how easy it is to confuse blockchain with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with altcoins. It really is no wonder that the ‚Äúman on the street‚Äù doesn‚Äôt understand these things, and consequently these misconceptions have become a real barrier to mainstream adoption. At the heart of blockchain, it really isn‚Äôt much more than a ledger or database (dependent on which descriptor you prefer). A blockchain database is unique, however, through its three pillars of being distributed (multiple copies of), being decentralised (no one copy has version control), and immutable (each transaction recorded is unchangeable). Bitcoin was the first blockchain, and as such is frequently referred to when trying to explain or understand blockchain. What the Bitcoin protocol (the underlying rules of the blockchain) solved technically was the double spend problem. This was key to creating a digital cash that was unforgeable. It‚Äôs easy to go too far down the rabbit hole on Bitcoin and start looking at the economic programming and proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors, but this takes us away from understanding blockchain. In order to offer a simple explanation of the difference between blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it‚Äôs best to use the analogy of the internet and email. Email, it‚Äôs widely agreed, was the internet‚Äôs first killer app ‚Äì so email is simply an application built on top of the internet, but the internet offers far more than just email. Similarly, Bitcoin was blockchain‚Äôs first killer app, and as such, all cryptocurrency is built on top of a blockchain ‚Äì but blockchain can do so much more than just cryptocurrency. With blockchain working as a shared ledger and acting as a trusted central source of truth, we can see organisations looking to solve such complex topics as digital identity (Sovrin), supply chain digital transformation (Tradelens), food provenance (IBM Food Trust), and efficiency in the transportation and logistic industry (BITA). Under the cloak of darkness, many companies are aiming to create proof of concepts that can deliver real-world results for their various industries. In time, the cloak will be lifted and we will see which ones have succeeded and, hopefully, which ones have failed and we can learn from. The Bitcoin protocol is slow, but this is not the protocol that would be used in enterprise environments. The Bitcoin protocol is energy hungry (through PoW), but enterprise blockchains would not use PoW as its consensus mechanism. If you‚Äôre looking at having a digital form of money, it makes sense that there should be a cost to creating it in the form of energy consumption. If you‚Äôre aiming to clean up the luxury goods markets from fakes and rip-offs, a consortia of luxury goods manufacturers and retailers using proof of authority makes sense ‚Äì it really is a case of horses for courses. The article also discusses the value that many intermediaries have, and this isn‚Äôt wrong. There are plenty of middlemen that actually add value to our every day lives, including the basic function of banking to be the trusted custodian of our money. However, there are also plenty of things that commercial banks do that do not add value, and we should take back sovereignty over ‚Äì international transfers of money for one. Centralised third-party middlemen are not the problem, the degree to which we can trust them to act on our behalf is. The BBC article misunderstands a basic precept about Bitcoin regarding the speed of transactions by comparing it to Mastercard and Visa. A better comparison for Bitcoin is gold, where transaction in the metal takes a long time and costs a lot of money as it‚Äôs generally done as a settlement layer at central bank level. One day in the future, I, and many others believe that Bitcoin will be able to be used as simply as Mastercard or Visa is today, but that requires a layer two solution (such as Lightning), and a much more significant market cap that would be in the trillions of dollars. We may be some way from that being a reality at the present time, but that is just a reason why we should make the effort to understand these issues today. The article jumps to talking about problems with other blockchain based currencies, known as altcoins, but without creating a clear distinction from Bitcoin and creating the clarification that there is no ‚Äúthe blockchain‚Äù, but actually many different flavours of the same concept. Many of the altcoins, are based upon a token that drives actions on top of the matching blockchain. For example, Ethereum was a new protocol that went live in 2015 and was intended to be a decentralised global computer with the ability to execute smart contracts. Ether was the token created both as a way to raise the initial funds to build the technology and is now the gas that powers it. Ethereum also paved the way for a glut of new tokens created by entrepreneurs (and scammers) on top of the Ethereum protocol, most of which only had a utility within the application built on top of it. Many people have tried to create new cryptocurrencies, some through forks of pre-existing protocols and coins (such as Bitcoin), and some as entirely new protocols. For some of the entrepreneurs that went down this road, it was little more than a way of making themselves rich. However the main problem with the altcoins when trying to be viewed as money, is that they tend to be overly centralised (meaning that the transactions and rules of the currency won‚Äôt have as much trust), and look to reduce energy consumption and speed up transaction throughput through different consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated PoS, and tend to lack scarcity ‚Äì if you understand economics, it‚Äôs fairly easy to see that without significant cost and scarcity, there can be no significant value created with respect to money. Again, look at the comparison to finding and excavating gold from the earth. My belief is that in ten years‚Äô time, Bitcoin will have either changed the world we live in or will have become virtually valueless. Conversely, I believe that blockchain is here to stay and will change the world but needs to fade into the background. The reality is that blockchain is still mostly hype, as was the internet in 1994. The industry needs time to develop ‚Äì just because it‚Äôs hype today, it doesn‚Äôt mean that there isn‚Äôt real world-changing tech there.

The Crypto Daily ‚Äì The Movers and Shakers 03/07/19," Bitcoin continued its trend-bucking form on Tuesday to end a string of losses at the turn of the quarter. Bitcoin rose by 2.29% on Tuesday. Reversing a 1.48% fall from Monday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,885. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide from a morning high $10,719 to a late morning intraday low $9,728.2. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $10,075 to test support at the 38.2% FIB of $9,734 before bouncing back. Rallying through the afternoon, Bitcoin struck a late intraday high $10,965 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin fell well short of the first major resistance level at $11,218. It was Bitcoin‚Äôs first visit to sub-$10,000 levels since 21st June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red across the crypto-board. Leading the way down was Binance Coin, which slid by 3.65%. Also seeing heavy losses were Litecoin (-3.26%), Tron (-2.89%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (-2.59%), and EOS (-2.37%). Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash SV saw more modest losses of 0.84% and 0.48% respectively. For Stellar‚Äôs Lumen, things haven‚Äôt improved since falling out of the top ten with a 2.16% loss on the day. With Bitcoin bucking the trend to see green on the day, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance moved back to 61% levels. The total crypto market cap recovered from sub-$290 levels on Tuesday to end the day at $313.2bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 2.73% to $11,182 as the bulls look to restore order. Moves within the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a low $10,876 to a high $11,200 before easing back. While leaving the major support and resistance levels untested early on, Bitcoin came within range of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day for the majors. Ethereum tracked Bitcoin early on, with a 1.01% gain. Tron (+0.94%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.03%), and Litecoin (+1.18%) also made solid gains. Bucking the trend in the early hours, however, was Binance Coin with a 0.31% loss. Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to bring the first major resistance level at $11,323.93 into play. Having failed to touch $11,000 levels on Tuesday, the early move should support a bullish day ahead. An early break through the first major resistance level would bring $11,500 levels into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall back through to $10,500 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,087.13 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,000 support levels on the day.

Latest Bitcoin price and analysis (BTC to USD)," At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading just above $11,450 after price crashed close to 23% from $13,800 to $10,500 during the previous week. It seems the hypothesis that weekends are good for Bitcoin may not always be true, even though the price is now higher than it was one week ago as BTC consolidated above the key $11,000 level on Sunday. Will Bitcoin push higher during the week? Or will we see more major retracements back to the $10,000 region? Bitcoin is evolving as expected. Its overall value keeps increasing, and if you look at the volumes profile on the left of the graph above, you‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs plenty of volume keeping BTC above the critical $11,000 level. My prediction that Bitcoin could hit $20,000 by the end of the year could turn into an ‚Äúend of the month‚Äù kind of deal. Assuming the positive trend continues and BTC price continues to rise, we should expect higher volumes coming in at key levels close to $20,000. Although many retail investors will be looking to sell some of their gains when Bitcoin hits all-time highs again, we can expect the price to keep going at least for a few weeks. However, as the market becomes more liquid, we should expect fewer violent swings, so it could take longer for BTC to reach a new high. Let‚Äôs not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we‚Äôve already accomplished that goal ‚Äì not only in shorter time frames but also in daily and weekly ones as well ‚Äì I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past two weeks, volume has gone from $17 billion to $23 billion, consolidating now around $20 billion. Putting all this information together, we‚Äôre now clearly on the right path to reach $15,000 ‚Äì or maybe even $20,000 ‚Äì by the end of 2019. Of course, if you think I might be overreacting to positive news, you can always check what other expert analysts have to say about this recent price movement. Hopefully, the market will continue this positive momentum. Pay attention to retracements back down towards the 200-day EMA to make new entries. Safe trades!

35," Facebook (FB) Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs recent announcement of ambitious plans to launch a¬†new, global cryptocurrency called Libra¬†has been met with understandable alarm, particularly among regulators and consumer advocates. Much of the controversy has centered around antitrust issues, consumer privacy, and the ability of crooks to anonymously use the system for illicit purposes. Those are all legitimate concerns, but to my mind, the biggest risks are financial, both to users of Libra and the financial system as a whole. Those risks include the possibility of bank runs, credit disruptions, or consumer losses arising from foreign currency risks or financial mismanagement of the Libra reserve. The best way to understand these risks is to follow the money. Let‚Äôs start with the process of buying and redeeming Libra. Most cryptocurrencies, including the granddaddy of them all, Bitcoin, have failed to gain widespread acceptance as a method of payment because of their volatility. Zuckerberg hopes to avoid this problem by backing Libra with a reserve of stable world currencies, including the dollar, Euro, and Swiss franc. So you can buy Libra with pretty much any fiat currency ‚Äî a U.S. dollar, Brazilian Real, Mongolian Tugrik, Indian Rupee ‚Äî but the amount of Libra you receive will depend on the exchange rate between your currency and the basket of currencies in the reserve at the time of purchase. When you want to redeem your Libra back into your fiat currency, you may get more. But you may also get a lot less, particularly in developing countries with unstable currencies. It will depend on the exchange rate at the time of redemption. Let‚Äôs say you still want to buy this hip new digital coin, regardless of the foreign exchange risk. Where do you get the money? For citizens in the U.S. and other developed countries, the money will probably come from your bank account. It‚Äôs not going to hurt the banking system if you withdraw a few hundred a month for Libra transactions. But what if everyone decides they want to replace their bank accounts with Libra? After all, this would be a great way to avoid checking account fees. Retailers will love Libra as a way to avoid paying network fees on debit and credit card transactions. All of a sudden, that giant sucking sound is money coming out of the banks and into Libra‚Äôs kitty. You may think, ‚ÄúFine. Let‚Äôs stick it to the banks. Look what they did to the economy in 2008.‚Äù But most of that money you withdraw from the banks is money they will no longer have to lend to the economy. So as Libra captures your cash, banks have less to make loans. With a run on the banks, we also get a credit contraction. Now Libra has your money (not the banks) and you have your digital coins. What will Libra do with your money?¬†Libra‚Äôs white paper¬†says your digital coin is safe because it will be backed by a basket of the most stable world currencies. But it‚Äôs not as if Libra will be purchasing paper money in each of these currencies and piling them in a bank vault. What this really means is that Libra will be taking your money and investing it in instruments denominated in those currencies. The return on these investments is how Facebook and other Libra founders will make money. Thus they will have incentives to invest in instruments that will maximize those returns, which may or may not maintain the stable value Libra‚Äôs founders are promising. The white paper promises to invest in low volatility assets such as bank deposits and short-term government securities, using ‚Äúinvestment grade‚Äù financial institutions as custodians. (Reminder: Lehman Bros had an ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating from Standard and Poor‚Äôs before its collapse in 2008.) But there is no regulatory body to ensure that it does so, nor to require that Libra‚Äôs sponsors put up any of their own capital or reserves to backstop those investments if they go sour. In essence, Libra proposes the failed business model used by money market funds prior to the financial crisis. It wants you to buy Libra on the promise that the coin will maintain stable value, but there will be no regulatory oversight of what Libra actually does with your money and no capital and liquidity requirements that you would typically find with a bank. That structure proved disastrous during the 2008 crisis, when the Reserve Fund, a money market fund that heavily invested in Lehman Bros debt, ‚Äúbroke the buck‚Äù and prompted widespread runs on other money market funds. Even if Libra keeps its promise to put your money only in relatively safe bank deposits and government securities, we still have a problem. If the money comes out of banks (where it supports private sector lending) and goes into government securities, we would see a massive re-allocation of resources from the private to the public sectors. If you believe (as do I) that the market is generally a better allocator of economic resources than the government, this re-allocation will serve as a drag on economic growth. Libra says it will also put your money into bank deposits. Bank accounts have the advantage of maintaining stable value. Your bank account balance doesn‚Äôt fluctuate as would a securities investment. And perhaps this helps with our bank run problem. You take money out of your bank to buy Libra. Libra puts yours and other users‚Äô money into other banks, which will presumably use it to make loans. But banks do fail, and depositors take losses on their uninsured deposits. So while Libra is saying it‚Äôs offering a better alternative to banks because it won‚Äôt be taking risk by lending out your money the way banks do, it will be putting at least some of your money right back into banks of its choosing. When you withdrew money from your bank to buy Libra, you probably had less than $250,000 in your account, meaning it was fully protected by the FDIC. But Libra‚Äôs founders hope to have a global reserve of hundreds of billions of dollars. Even if they spread the funds among multiple banks, at those levels, the lion‚Äôs share will likely be uninsured. Anyone who has followed my writings on blockchain knows that I‚Äôm enthusiastic about the use of distributed ledger technology to remove frictions in the payments system. So I don‚Äôt mean to sound too negative. The problem is, so long as cryptocurrencies have to rely on fiat currencies to maintain stable value, they will be exposed to the same kinds of risks embedded in the banking systems that support those currencies. I believe most of these risks can be addressed with thoughtful regulation. But before Mark Zuckenberg or anyone else tries to create his own global currency, we need to settle on an adequate regulatory framework to govern them. It would make sense for Congress to give the Federal Reserve Board lead authority for overseeing Libra, given its responsibility to conduct monetary policy and oversee an effective and efficient payments system. It is also an experienced financial supervisor, well-equipped to develop capital and liquidity requirements for Libra and other such ventures. In exercising that authority, the Fed could build on the pioneering work of the New York Department of Financial Services which currently regulates two trust companies which have successfully launched stable coins backed by the U.S. dollar. (Disclosure. I serve on the board of one of those trusts, Paxos.) Technology has the potential to dramatically change how the world pays for things in the future. Whether that transition is beneficial to consumers and businesses or financially disruptive will depend on whether regulators can stay ahead of this potentially rapid transformation. It‚Äôs open to question whether Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are the right stewards for a new global cryptocurrency. But by firing this warning shot to government policy makers that such a change is coming and potentially coming soon, they have done a public service.

Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.¬† The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of ‚Äúdigital payment tokens‚Äù in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, ‚Äúwill not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.‚Äù The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: ‚Äú(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.‚Äù  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. ‚ÄúA digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,‚Äù it said.",Yogita Khatri,The Block,2019-07-08T07:12:34.000Z

1," At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading just above $11,450 after price crashed close to 23% from $13,800 to $10,500 during the previous week. It seems the hypothesis that weekends are good for Bitcoin may not always be true, even though the price is now higher than it was one week ago as BTC consolidated above the key $11,000 level on Sunday. Will Bitcoin push higher during the week? Or will we see more major retracements back to the $10,000 region? Bitcoin is evolving as expected. Its overall value keeps increasing, and if you look at the volumes profile on the left of the graph above, you‚Äôll notice there‚Äôs plenty of volume keeping BTC above the critical $11,000 level. My prediction that Bitcoin could hit $20,000 by the end of the year could turn into an ‚Äúend of the month‚Äù kind of deal. Assuming the positive trend continues and BTC price continues to rise, we should expect higher volumes coming in at key levels close to $20,000. Although many retail investors will be looking to sell some of their gains when Bitcoin hits all-time highs again, we can expect the price to keep going at least for a few weeks. However, as the market becomes more liquid, we should expect fewer violent swings, so it could take longer for BTC to reach a new high. Let‚Äôs not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we‚Äôve already accomplished that goal ‚Äì not only in shorter time frames but also in daily and weekly ones as well ‚Äì I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past two weeks, volume has gone from $17 billion to $23 billion, consolidating now around $20 billion. Putting all this information together, we‚Äôre now clearly on the right path to reach $15,000 ‚Äì or maybe even $20,000 ‚Äì by the end of 2019. Of course, if you think I might be overreacting to positive news, you can always check what other expert analysts have to say about this recent price movement.

The Crypto Daily ‚Äì The Movers and Shakers 08/07/19," Bitcoin closed out the week in positive territory, resuming what has been a particularly bullish run since January. Year-to-date Bitcoin has seen just 8 weekly losses, 2 of which came in June. On Sunday, Bitcoin rose by 1.85%, following on from a 2.56% gain on Saturday, to end the day at $11,485. It was a relatively range-bound first half of the day. Bitcoin eased back to a mid-morning intraday low $11,110 before recovering to a late morning high $11,375. The late morning rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 that provided much-needed support through the morning. Falling back from $11,400 levels struck in the middle of the day, Bitcoin slipped through the 23.6% FIB to $11,150 levels before finding support. Bitcoin bounced back to a late intraday high $11,620 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin came up short of the first major resistance level at $11,680.33. For the week, the weekend gains delivered a 6.34% rise for the week ending 7th July. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was green across the board for majors on Sunday. Leading the way on the day were Tron‚Äôs TRX and Ethereum, which saw gains of 8.94% and 6.52% respectively. EOS also outperformed Bitcoin on the day, rising by 3.28%. The rest of the pack saw more modest gains. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+1.79%), Ripple‚Äôs XRP (+1.81%), Binance Coin (+1.91%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.96%) stood alongside Bitcoin on the day. Litecoin saw the most modest gain of the day, however, rising by 1.71%. For the week, Tron‚Äôs TRX led the way, rallying by 10.06% to cement its position in the number 10 spot by market cap. Bucking the trend in the week was Litecoin, which fell by 1.52%. Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance held onto 62% levels, having peaked at 63% levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance stood at 62.1%. The total crypto market cap rose from $313.57bn to a high $337.76bn on Thursday before easing back to $330bn levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.39% to $11,440. Moves at the start of the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,547 to a low $11,413. Bitcoin steered clear of the major support and resistance levels early on. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Tron‚Äôs TRX bucked the trend early, rising by 0.49% and by 0.29% respectively. The rest of the pack were in the red, with Bitcoin Cash SV leading the way down with a 1.47% loss. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,400 levels to make a move later in the day. A move through the morning high to $11,600 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,700 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Sunday‚Äôs high $11,620 and the first major resistance level will likely limit any upside. Failure to hold onto $11,400 levels could see Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. A pullback to $11,200 levels would bring the first major support level at $11,190 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 support levels on the day.

"SEC seeks blockchain data provider to monitor risk, improve compliance, and inform policy"," The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is getting ever more serious about blockchain data. While many of the world's governments and politicians focus on Facebook's recently introduced Libra and data sharing among virtual asset providers, the SEC is seeking more data on public blockchains. The requirements listed by the SEC specific that all data is sourced from hosted notes rather than blockchain explorers. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are mandatory, while Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Zcash, EOS, NEO and XRP data are all specified as desirable. In addition, as new blockchains gain increased prominence, the SEC would require support for them. The SEC is seeking full blockchain data from the genesis block or inception and information about any derivative currencies (tokens) affiliated with these blockchains. The required data format is very specific with normalized fields for each included blockchain sourced from on-node data, in its entirety. The minimum fields specified are ticker symbol; send and receive addresses; transaction hash, timestamp and amounts; unspent send and receive balances; transaction fees; confirmations; block hash; and block height. If possible, the SEC also seeks further metadata and chain metrics such as hashing algorithms, hashing power, mining difficulty and rewards, transactions quantity and size, coin supply and blockchain size. The data is expected to be provided directly by the vendor's own node for each blockchain using a secure, encrypted data feed; synced with the network; and run in a secure, controlled environment. The data must also be presented with means to validate its accuracy and completeness and meet the requirements of financial statement audit testing. The contract length will be for one year, followed by four optional 12 month terms. A technical quote and price quote are both required for application. The SEC's deadline for submission by prospective data vendors is 12pm EST on July 11, 2019.¬†",The Block,None,2019-07-06T12:22:01.000Z

Why the Fed should oversee Facebook‚Äôs Libra," Facebook (FB) Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs recent announcement of ambitious plans to launch a¬†new, global cryptocurrency called Libra¬†has been met with understandable alarm, particularly among regulators and consumer advocates. Much of the controversy has centered around antitrust issues, consumer privacy, and the ability of crooks to anonymously use the system for illicit purposes. Those are all legitimate concerns, but to my mind, the biggest risks are financial, both to users of Libra and the financial system as a whole. Those risks include the possibility of bank runs, credit disruptions, or consumer losses arising from foreign currency risks or financial mismanagement of the Libra reserve. The best way to understand these risks is to follow the money. Let‚Äôs start with the process of buying and redeeming Libra. Most cryptocurrencies, including the granddaddy of them all, Bitcoin, have failed to gain widespread acceptance as a method of payment because of their volatility. Zuckerberg hopes to avoid this problem by backing Libra with a reserve of stable world currencies, including the dollar, Euro, and Swiss franc. So you can buy Libra with pretty much any fiat currency ‚Äî a U.S. dollar, Brazilian Real, Mongolian Tugrik, Indian Rupee ‚Äî but the amount of Libra you receive will depend on the exchange rate between your currency and the basket of currencies in the reserve at the time of purchase. When you want to redeem your Libra back into your fiat currency, you may get more. But you may also get a lot less, particularly in developing countries with unstable currencies. It will depend on the exchange rate at the time of redemption. Let‚Äôs say you still want to buy this hip new digital coin, regardless of the foreign exchange risk. Where do you get the money? For citizens in the U.S. and other developed countries, the money will probably come from your bank account. It‚Äôs not going to hurt the banking system if you withdraw a few hundred a month for Libra transactions. But what if everyone decides they want to replace their bank accounts with Libra? After all, this would be a great way to avoid checking account fees. Retailers will love Libra as a way to avoid paying network fees on debit and credit card transactions. All of a sudden, that giant sucking sound is money coming out of the banks and into Libra‚Äôs kitty. You may think, ‚ÄúFine. Let‚Äôs stick it to the banks. Look what they did to the economy in 2008.‚Äù But most of that money you withdraw from the banks is money they will no longer have to lend to the economy. So as Libra captures your cash, banks have less to make loans. With a run on the banks, we also get a credit contraction. Now Libra has your money (not the banks) and you have your digital coins. What will Libra do with your money?¬†Libra‚Äôs white paper¬†says your digital coin is safe because it will be backed by a basket of the most stable world currencies. But it‚Äôs not as if Libra will be purchasing paper money in each of these currencies and piling them in a bank vault. What this really means is that Libra will be taking your money and investing it in instruments denominated in those currencies. The return on these investments is how Facebook and other Libra founders will make money. Thus they will have incentives to invest in instruments that will maximize those returns, which may or may not maintain the stable value Libra‚Äôs founders are promising. The white paper promises to invest in low volatility assets such as bank deposits and short-term government securities, using ‚Äúinvestment grade‚Äù financial institutions as custodians. (Reminder: Lehman Bros had an ‚ÄúA‚Äù rating from Standard and Poor‚Äôs before its collapse in 2008.) But there is no regulatory body to ensure that it does so, nor to require that Libra‚Äôs sponsors put up any of their own capital or reserves to backstop those investments if they go sour. In essence, Libra proposes the failed business model used by money market funds prior to the financial crisis. It wants you to buy Libra on the promise that the coin will maintain stable value, but there will be no regulatory oversight of what Libra actually does with your money and no capital and liquidity requirements that you would typically find with a bank. That structure proved disastrous during the 2008 crisis, when the Reserve Fund, a money market fund that heavily invested in Lehman Bros debt, ‚Äúbroke the buck‚Äù and prompted widespread runs on other money market funds. Even if Libra keeps its promise to put your money only in relatively safe bank deposits and government securities, we still have a problem. If the money comes out of banks (where it supports private sector lending) and goes into government securities, we would see a massive re-allocation of resources from the private to the public sectors. If you believe (as do I) that the market is generally a better allocator of economic resources than the government, this re-allocation will serve as a drag on economic growth. Libra says it will also put your money into bank deposits. Bank accounts have the advantage of maintaining stable value. Your bank account balance doesn‚Äôt fluctuate as would a securities investment. And perhaps this helps with our bank run problem. You take money out of your bank to buy Libra. Libra puts yours and other users‚Äô money into other banks, which will presumably use it to make loans. But banks do fail, and depositors take losses on their uninsured deposits. So while Libra is saying it‚Äôs offering a better alternative to banks because it won‚Äôt be taking risk by lending out your money the way banks do, it will be putting at least some of your money right back into banks of its choosing. When you withdrew money from your bank to buy Libra, you probably had less than $250,000 in your account, meaning it was fully protected by the FDIC. But Libra‚Äôs founders hope to have a global reserve of hundreds of billions of dollars. Even if they spread the funds among multiple banks, at those levels, the lion‚Äôs share will likely be uninsured. Anyone who has followed my writings on blockchain knows that I‚Äôm enthusiastic about the use of distributed ledger technology to remove frictions in the payments system. So I don‚Äôt mean to sound too negative. The problem is, so long as cryptocurrencies have to rely on fiat currencies to maintain stable value, they will be exposed to the same kinds of risks embedded in the banking systems that support those currencies. I believe most of these risks can be addressed with thoughtful regulation. But before Mark Zuckenberg or anyone else tries to create his own global currency, we need to settle on an adequate regulatory framework to govern them. It would make sense for Congress to give the Federal Reserve Board lead authority for overseeing Libra, given its responsibility to conduct monetary policy and oversee an effective and efficient payments system. It is also an experienced financial supervisor, well-equipped to develop capital and liquidity requirements for Libra and other such ventures. In exercising that authority, the Fed could build on the pioneering work of the New York Department of Financial Services which currently regulates two trust companies which have successfully launched stable coins backed by the U.S. dollar. (Disclosure. I serve on the board of one of those trusts, Paxos.) Technology has the potential to dramatically change how the world pays for things in the future. Whether that transition is beneficial to consumers and businesses or financially disruptive will depend on whether regulators can stay ahead of this potentially rapid transformation. It‚Äôs open to question whether Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are the right stewards for a new global cryptocurrency. But by firing this warning shot to government policy makers that such a change is coming and potentially coming soon, they have done a public service.

2," The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is getting ever more serious about blockchain data. While many of the world's governments and politicians focus on Facebook's recently introduced Libra and data sharing among virtual asset providers, the SEC is seeking more data on public blockchains. The requirements listed by the SEC specific that all data is sourced from hosted notes rather than blockchain explorers. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are mandatory, while Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Zcash, EOS, NEO and XRP data are all specified as desirable. In addition, as new blockchains gain increased prominence, the SEC would require support for them. The SEC is seeking full blockchain data from the genesis block or inception and information about any derivative currencies (tokens) affiliated with these blockchains. The required data format is very specific with normalized fields for each included blockchain sourced from on-node data, in its entirety. The minimum fields specified are ticker symbol; send and receive addresses; transaction hash, timestamp and amounts; unspent send and receive balances; transaction fees; confirmations; block hash; and block height. If possible, the SEC also seeks further metadata and chain metrics such as hashing algorithms, hashing power, mining difficulty and rewards, transactions quantity and size, coin supply and blockchain size. The data is expected to be provided directly by the vendor's own node for each blockchain using a secure, encrypted data feed; synced with the network; and run in a secure, controlled environment. The data must also be presented with means to validate its accuracy and completeness and meet the requirements of financial statement audit testing. The contract length will be for one year, followed by four optional 12 month terms. A technical quote and price quote are both required for application. The SEC's deadline for submission by prospective data vendors is 12pm EST on July 11, 2019.¬†",The Block,None,2019-07-06T12:22:01.000Z

Bitcoin Tech Analysis ‚Äì Recap and Mid-Day Review ‚Äì 08/07/19," Bitcoin rose by 1.85% on Sunday. Following on from a 2.56% gain on Saturday, Bitcoin ended the week up 6.34% to $11,485. On the day, a relatively range-bound morning saw Bitcoin fall to an intraday low $11,110 before finding support. The pullback saw Bitcoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 before recovering to $11,300 levels. A second pullback in the afternoon, saw Bitcoin fall back through the 23.6% FIB before striking an intraday high $11,620. On the day, while Bitcoin fell short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin‚Äôs move back through the 23.6% FIB was key. The bullish end to the week contributed to yet another weekly gain and there have been numerous since the start of the year. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin has seen just 8 weeks in the red, which has given Bitcoin a 200% gain year-to-date. All of this in spite of a pullback from 26th June‚Äôs current year high $13,764. Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance held onto 62% levels. Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap has also found support, recovering from sub-$200bn levels on Sunday to $211.17bn at the time of writing. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December‚Äôs swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin has continued to find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 3.49% to $11,886.0. Range-bound through the early morning, Bitcoin fell from a start of a day $11,547 to a morning low $11,310 before making a move. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and the first major support level at $11,190, Bitcoin rallied to a late morning high $12,040. Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $11,700 and second major resistance level at $11,915 to hit $12,000 levels before easing back. A hold above the first major resistance level at $11,700 would support another break through the second major resistance level at $11,915. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high $12,040. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin would likely come up short of the third major resistance level at $12,425. In the event of a crypto rally, expect Bitcoin to take a run at $13,000 levels. This morning‚Äôs divergence has set the bulls up for a big afternoon if the rest the majors can recover. Failure to hold above the first major resistance level at $11,700 would see Bitcoin cough up the morning gain. A pullback through to sub-$11,400 levels would bring the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, we would expect Bitcoin to steer clear of the first major support level at $11,190. In the event of a meltdown, sub-$11,000 support levels could come into play before any recovery. We would expect the second major support level at $10,895 to limit any downside in the event of a sell-off.

1," Bitcoin closed out the week in positive territory, resuming what has been a particularly bullish run since January. Year-to-date Bitcoin has seen just 8 weekly losses, 2 of which came in June. On Sunday, Bitcoin rose by 1.85%, following on from a 2.56% gain on Saturday, to end the day at $11,485. It was a relatively range-bound first half of the day. Bitcoin eased back to a mid-morning intraday low $11,110 before recovering to a late morning high $11,375. The late morning rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 that provided much-needed support through the morning. Falling back from $11,400 levels struck in the middle of the day, Bitcoin slipped through the 23.6% FIB to $11,150 levels before finding support. Bitcoin bounced back to a late intraday high $11,620 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin came up short of the first major resistance level at $11,680.33. For the week, the weekend gains delivered a 6.34% rise for the week ending 7th July. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was green across the board for majors on Sunday. Leading the way on the day were Tron‚Äôs TRX and Ethereum, which saw gains of 8.94% and 6.52% respectively. EOS also outperformed Bitcoin on the day, rising by 3.28%. The rest of the pack saw more modest gains. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+1.79%), Ripple‚Äôs XRP (+1.81%), Binance Coin (+1.91%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.96%) stood alongside Bitcoin on the day. Litecoin saw the most modest gain of the day, however, rising by 1.71%. For the week, Tron‚Äôs TRX led the way, rallying by 10.06% to cement its position in the number 10 spot by market cap. Bucking the trend in the week was Litecoin, which fell by 1.52%. Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance held onto 62% levels, having peaked at 63% levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance stood at 62.1%. The total crypto market cap rose from $313.57bn to a high $337.76bn on Thursday before easing back to $330bn levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.39% to $11,440. Moves at the start of the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,547 to a low $11,413. Bitcoin steered clear of the major support and resistance levels early on. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Tron‚Äôs TRX bucked the trend early, rising by 0.49% and by 0.29% respectively. The rest of the pack were in the red, with Bitcoin Cash SV leading the way down with a 1.47% loss. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,400 levels to make a move later in the day. A move through the morning high to $11,600 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,700 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Sunday‚Äôs high $11,620 and the first major resistance level will likely limit any upside. Failure to hold onto $11,400 levels could see Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. A pullback to $11,200 levels would bring the first major support level at $11,190 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 support levels on the day.

2," The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is getting ever more serious about blockchain data. While many of the world's governments and politicians focus on Facebook's recently introduced Libra and data sharing among virtual asset providers, the SEC is seeking more data on public blockchains. The requirements listed by the SEC specific that all data is sourced from hosted notes rather than blockchain explorers. The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are mandatory, while Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Zcash, EOS, NEO and XRP data are all specified as desirable. In addition, as new blockchains gain increased prominence, the SEC would require support for them. The SEC is seeking full blockchain data from the genesis block or inception and information about any derivative currencies (tokens) affiliated with these blockchains. The required data format is very specific with normalized fields for each included blockchain sourced from on-node data, in its entirety. The minimum fields specified are ticker symbol; send and receive addresses; transaction hash, timestamp and amounts; unspent send and receive balances; transaction fees; confirmations; block hash; and block height. If possible, the SEC also seeks further metadata and chain metrics such as hashing algorithms, hashing power, mining difficulty and rewards, transactions quantity and size, coin supply and blockchain size. The data is expected to be provided directly by the vendor's own node for each blockchain using a secure, encrypted data feed; synced with the network; and run in a secure, controlled environment. The data must also be presented with means to validate its accuracy and completeness and meet the requirements of financial statement audit testing. The contract length will be for one year, followed by four optional 12 month terms. A technical quote and price quote are both required for application. The SEC's deadline for submission by prospective data vendors is 12pm EST on July 11, 2019.¬†",The Block,None,2019-07-06T12:22:01.000Z
