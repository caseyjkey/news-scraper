"Facebook scam targets UAE residents, claims endorsement from Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince"," A Facebook scam has been targeting United Arab Emirates residents, The National writes. Scammers used the image of Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince, claiming he endorses the Bitcoin projects and is helping people make profits. According to the report, the scam was disseminated on Facebook via a sponsored post, which has been shared thousands of times and has generated even more comments. However, at the moment, it is not certain how many people were tricked into sending their money. Fraudsters promised that the scheme, which cost AED 1,000 (approximately $270), would make people “rich in seven days.” The sponsored post included a fake quote from the Crown Prince, claiming the scheme was his “way of giving back to the people.” The post linked to a fake news story that mixed facts with fabrications; it included a fake quote from Bill Gates and as well as a fictitious tweet from Sheikh Mohamed. The story itself was penned by a nonexistent journalist Michael Alvarado, and used a picture of a U.S.-based freelance journalist Timothy Seppala, who had been unaware his picture was used for a scam. Since the scam has been unearthed, the Facebook page used for the scam has been deleted.  The Abu Dhabi Media Office has urged people to “check the authenticity of campaigns asking for pledges or donations in case of fraud, particularly online and on social media.”",Carol Gaszcz,The Block,2019-07-01T19:51:26.000Z
18," The value of bitcoin is up 102% in 2019. But the most important story playing out in the cryptocurrency world right now is an enforcement action by the SEC against Canadian chat app Kik Interactive. If you follow cryptocurrency at all—either as a speculative investor or as a believer in the technology—you should pay close attention to what happens next. On Monday, the SEC sued Kik for its “unregistered” ICO (initial coin offering) back in 2017, which the agency says was an illegal securities offering. In the token sale, Kik created and sold 1 trillion Kin tokens and raised $100 million; the SEC says $55 million of that came from U.S.-based investors. It was one of the five biggest ICOs of 2017. Kik, which has about 200 employees, knew the SEC action might be coming: In November 2018, the SEC issued Kik a Wells Notice, which informs companies that the agency is considering enforcement action. In a Medium blog post in January, Kik CEO Ted Livingston responded to the notice, promising that “We’re fighting back.” In that blog post, Livingston correctly wrote, “This is the thing that everyone in the industry is dealing with, but nobody wants to talk about... This situation is not unique to Kik. There are dozens of projects at a similar point with the SEC.” As Yahoo Finance reported last year in a joint investigation with Decrypt, the SEC had been reaching out to dozens of companies that conducted ICOs to request documentation or threaten enforcement—and in many cases quietly got settlements. But in November 2018 the SEC’s crusade against unregistered token sales got a lot less quiet when it publicly announced a handful of settlements. That month it also slapped boxer Floyd Mayweather with more than $600,000 in fines and rapper DJ Khaled with $152,000 in fines for promoting ICOs on their social media accounts. This new lawsuit against Kik is the most noteworthy enforcement action to date, and the result will be important for the entire industry. It might set the new standard of how companies conduct an ICO, if any still dare to try it. (Blockstack is already looking to pull off the first big ICO conducted with full SEC registration and approval.) The core issue the SEC has with ICOs is simple: it believes almost every token sale is a security offering. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton made that stance clear at a Senate hearing in February 2018 when he said, “I believe every ICO I’ve seen is a security.”   Capital raising through blockchain requires compliance with federal securities laws https://t.co/IjOxjoVdfK The SEC bases its view on SEC v. Howey, a 1946 case involving the selling of shares in a citrus grove. The SEC applies the Howey Test to determine whether an offering is raising money from investors in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit from the efforts of others. In its official Wells Response in November 2018, Kik retorted that buyers of Kin coins “were not led to expect profits from the efforts of others.” Kik CEO Livingston also makes the case that Kin is truly used as a currency and not a security, since Kik users can earn and spend Kin inside the Kik app and in other apps as well. Now it’s worth revisiting what Livingston said in interviews back in 2017 about the Kin ICO. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, he said, “Kin is a new way for us to monetize and compete... If supply [of Kin] stays constant and demand for it grows, the value of the cryptocurrency will grow. So that if we set some of it aside for ourselves, we can make a lot of money... If we can create Kin, integrate it into Kik, that will make it really valuable.” Does that sound like a company promising returns from a securities offering? The SEC believes it does. In the 49-page complaint, the SEC writes: “Kik marketed the Kin tokens as an investment opportunity. Kik allegedly told investors that rising demand would drive up the value of Kin.” The SEC also accuses Kik of resorting to an ICO as a “hail Mary pass” because the company was “faced with a shrinking financial runway” and “decided to pivot.” And indeed, in the same 2017 interview with Yahoo Finance, Livingston made the point that Kik and other tech startups needed to innovate and try new things in order to avoid getting “copied and crushed” by giants like Facebook. But the SEC’s lawsuit against Kik is no guaranteed win. Kik, which says it has 15 million monthly users, clearly does not intend to settle, even though it has already spent $5 million in legal fees dealing with the SEC.

," In a recent interview on London Real, the Bitcoin and open blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos talked about the wrong type of people entering the digital asset economy, and why many end up staying for different reasons other than price. On the topic of the many hype-based cryptocurrency projects we see today, Antonopoulos said that the industry sometimes attracts the wrong type of crowd into the ecosystem. “It attracts scammers, opportunists, pump and dumpers, and pyramid schemes, and the ICO market enabled a lot of those people to make their own coins.” Andreas said that one of the reasons the ICO craze happened was because Ethereum made it easy for people to build a scalable, secure, transferable, and censorship-resistant blockchain “just by writing 20 lines of code”. But the Mastering Ethereum author said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains “to build platforms to do massive pump and dumps” instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance. However, he did mention that in the long run, “if you can fund start-ups with an international pool of investors, that can change the investment fields”. FOMO is in the air. Newbies are joining the cryptocurrency space and falling prey to scammers.  Please educate your friends and family:– Promises of profit are 100% ponzi– Request to ""recruit"", ""affiliate"" etc are 100% pyramid schemes– ICO/IEO are 99.99% pump-and-dump — Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) June 20, 2019  Regarding the parabolic rises and falls of many crypto assets, Andreas said that “nothing goes exponential without going down”, and that Bitcoin has done this eight times already as “that’s how it grows”. “The reason it grows like this is that there isn’t much in terms of short pressure to hold it down,” he said. “If you’ve got something that has limited supply and you suddenly have a speculative mania that blows up, it will continue to go up in a straight line, which only further fuels the mania. “Until it reaches a point where there simply isn’t anybody else who feels just as enthusiastic and it pauses for a second, the panic just drives [the price] down.” Andreas said that there’s “no difference between speculators and investors” and that they’re just speculating with a different risk profile, with some of them doing so “with very little research and information”. He said that the reason this is bad is that “a lot of good, innocent, and slightly naive people lost a lot of money” and had their lives destroyed because of this. This has a negative effect “as it changes the community” and “causes damage to the community”. “You have a lot of drama that comes up when there’s money on the table – people’s personalities change.” He said that people start taking shortcuts and their ethics become compromised – “power corrupts, money corrupts”. Andreas said that the majority of people first got involved in crypto most likely “because they heard that it’s some kind of investment opportunity”. He made the case that even though many of these people may have first entered the space “because of speculation and mania”, the people who were only motivated by price left during the 2018 crash, with those who stayed “finding other motivations”. He claimed some of the reasons why people stay is because they like the community, they understand the technology, and they may even be “driven by the political implications”. To those people, Andreas said: “Welcome, you may have come because you want to get rich – that’s okay. Now let me tell you about why you should stay because of the technology even after the price crashes.”   The post Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Nawaz Sulemanji,Coin Rivet,2019-07-03T13:00:11.000Z

XRP Keeps Retreating," On the daily time-frame the ascending trend of the XRP has “stumbled over” a long-term resistance line. After a divergence formed on MACD, the price started declining until it broke through the local support line. It might imply further decline up to the long-term support line around 0.2990. Resistance line should be marked at 0.4785; breaking through this line will signal the start of a stable ascending trend. On H4 the XRP tries to take hold at the lower projected channel. The short-term goal of the decline is the support area around 0.3525. Bearing in mind the Stochastic in the overbought area, a drop to 0.3980 is possible after reaching the local goal. The financial world is not ready for new solutions, says Technical Director of Ripple David Schwartz in his interview to CB Insights. He states that the technical solutions by Ripple, such as xRapid and xCurrent, have solved the problem of inter-bank transactions, which was the major issue of the banking system SWIFT. However, banks are not too eager to implement new technologies, being conservative and slow by their nature. Schwartz says that new solutions for payment systems are aggressive, swift, mobile and oriented on accelerated target-hitting. It helps save the time and money. Banks will adopt the new schemes sooner or later, but they are not ready yet. The main problem is that the aspects of market regulation are not thoroughly worked out yet, so the bank ecosystem does not feel completely protected, which is understandable. At the same the very nature of digital assets and blockchain-based approaches is still immature, which also prevents banks from implementing modern technologies. This year the XRP is rising in price slower than the leading currency BTC or other altcoins. It might be due to investors waiting for stronger fundamental catalysts that will provide for long-term rise of the XRP.

The Crypto Week – The Majors Hit Reverse 09/06/19," It’s been a bearish start to the month of June as the bears look to claw back control of the reins. Bitcoin fell by 0.95% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 2.36% gain from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $7,924.0. Bearish through most of the day, Bitcoin fell from an early morning intraday high $8,069.0 to a late afternoon intraday low $7,800.1. Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $8,178.63, Bitcoin came within range of the first major support level at $7,791.53 before finding late support. For the current week, Monday through Saturday, Bitcoin was down by 9.34% in spite of 3 consecutive days in the green mid-week. A bearish start to the week did the damage, with Bitcoin seeing heavy losses in the first 2-days of the week. In spite of the bearish week, Bitcoin managed to hold above the 23.6% FIB of $7,718 and touch $8,000 levels before reversing. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed bag for the pack. Bucking the trend from across the broader market, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash SV held onto gains through the current week. Monday through Saturday, Litecoin led the way with a 3.33% gain, with Bitcoin Cash SV up by 2.63%. Elsewhere, it was a sea of red. Leading the way down was EOS, which had tumbled by 17.6%. Bitcoin Cash ABC was a distant second, sliding by 11.5%. Ethereum (-9.3%), Stellar’s Lumen (-8.7%) and Ripple’s XRP (-8.1%) were also deep in the red for the week. The sell-off through the current week came as 24-hour trading volumes fell from $72bn levels at the start of the week to $57bn levels at the time of writing. The total crypto market cap slid from $275bn levels to $250bn levels at the time of writing. On the rankings, EOS’s heavy losses in the week led to a fall to the number 6 spot. Litecoin’s trend-bucking moves led to a move through to the number 4 spot, with Bitcoin Cash ABC at number 5. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.73% to $7,865.8. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning high $7,963.3 to a low $7,851.5. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested in the early part of the day. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash SV, EOS and Litecoin saw the heaviest losses in the early hours. Bitcoin Cash SV led the way, down by 2.82% at the time of writing. EOS and Litecoin were down by 1.73% and 1.97% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move through to $7,930 to support a run at the first major resistance level at $8,061.30. The sentiment from across the broader market would need to materially improve, however, for Bitcoin to move back through to $7,900 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, Bitcoin would likely come up short of $8,000 levels. Failure to move through to $7,930 levels could see Bitcoin fall deeper into the red. A fall back through the morning low $7,851.5 would bring the first major support level at $7,793.4 into play. Barring an extended crypto sell-off through the day, Bitcoin would likely steer clear of sub-$7,700 levels.

Bitcoin Bulls on Fire as Prices Leap to Fresh Yearly High," Open your FXTM account today Investors wasted to no time rushing back to the crypto asset on rumours revolving around Facebook launching its own cryptocurrency. Market optimism about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies becoming widely accepted and adopted by mainstream entities could inspire bulls to target $10,000 in the medium to longer term. While the path of least resistance for Bitcoin currently points north amid the positivity, investors should not overlook how inherently volatile and unpredictable cryptocurrencies can be. Focusing on the technical picture, BTCUSD remains bullish on the daily charts. A solid daily close above $9300 should invite a move higher towards $9500 and $9700, respectively. Should $9000 prove to be unreliable support, Bitcoin is seen sinking back towards $8000.

Crypto market cap sinks after huge BTC dump," Cryptocurrencies dropped another $20 billion in combined market value on Monday – less than 24 hours after posting a similar drop over the weekend. The sharp decline in market value was triggered after a single trader unloaded 20,000 Bitcoin on the Bitfinex exchange. In the span of roughly 16 hours, the total cryptocurrency market cap has fallen by over $30 billion, according to TradingView. The total value of the entire market is now $283 billion – the lowest since June. With the exception of Tether (USDT), which has seen its market cap swell in recent months, all of the top-20 coins by market cap were trading lower on Monday. Looking at the chart above, we can see the crypto market has now pulled back a whopping $78 billion from its yearly peak, when it touched $380 billion. Still, the long-term trend remains intact as it’s still above the 20-day EMA. In the past, we’ve seen similar price consolidations during bullish seasons, meaning there’s no reason to panic at all. Last week, I wrote about how the long-term trend of Bitcoin remains positive and that I’m expecting the price to hit $20,000 by the end of the year. What I’m doing personally is taking this opportunity to increase my main portfolio. Whether you want to bet on some prominent altcoins or just buy BTC’s dips, my point is it’s a good idea to take these opportunities to average your buy-ins to disperse your risk over time. Try to buy on a daily or weekly basis instead of waiting for a certain price range. It’s always a safer choice! looks like someone just claimed 20,000 $BTC in shorts on bitfinex… wow pic.twitter.com/QQXiZ1oaFb — Crypto Loomdart (@loomdart) June 30, 2019  In other news, it seems the most recent dip was caused by a huge short-seller who unloaded around 20,000 BTC on the Bitfinex market. Bitcoin’s sharp correction over the last 24 hours has had a cascading effect on the broader cryptocurrency market. At 60% market dominance, Bitcoin exerts a strong gravitational pull on altcoins and tokens. As a result, Bitcoin’s renewed volatility has knocked billions off altcoin values over the past five days. Of course, that followed a parabolic surge that drove the overall market to a high close to $390 billion. If a single sell order was responsible for Bitcoin’s sharp correction, then investors can expect a swift recovery in the short term. Bitcoin whales (oversized holders of the virtual currency) seem to have been responsible for at least two major price reversals in recent months. Each time, markets bought the dip and drove the price to new yearly highs. One of the more dramatic examples of a Bitcoin whale dump occurred in mid-May when prices plunged by more than $1,000 in the span of a few hours. The selloff was caused by a single trader who unloaded 5,000 units of BTC on Bitstamp, a leading digital currency exchange. It’s expected during bull markets for whales to take profits while Bitcoin rises to new yearly highs. I personally will take these opportunities to accumulate some more coins. Safe trades!

The Crypto Week – Bitcoin Leads the Way as Volatility Grips the Majors," While the Bitcoin bulls maintained control, it has been a mixed week for the rest of the pack. Bitcoin fell by 3.38% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 10.18% rally from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,920. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide from an intraday high $12,338 to an early morning intraday low $11,354. Bitcoin steered clear of the first major support level at $11,285.67 and the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 before finding support. Recovering through the remainder of the day, Bitcoin moved back through to $12,000 levels before a late pullback. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 9.3%, which came off the back of 4 days in the green out of the last 6. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a bullish start to the weekend, leaving Bitcoin to buck the trend on the day. Across the rest of the majors, Litecoin led the way, rallying by 11.6% to reverse most of a Thursday 12.6% sell-off. Stellar’s Lumen (+3.87%), EOS (+2.59%), and Ethereum (+2.46%) saw solid gains on the day. For the current week, Bitcoin led the way with its 9.3% rally, Monday through Saturday. Stellar’s Lumen and Ethereum were also in the green for the current week, with gains of 8% and 3.3% respectively. The rest of the pack were in the red, however, with a broad-based crypto sell-off doing the damage on Thursday. Leading the way down was EOS, which tumbled by 13%. Bitcoin Cash SV and Ripple’s XRP also saw heavy losses, with declines of 10.2% and 9.4% respectively. Bitcoin Cash ABC (-6.34%), Binance Coin (-4.35%) and Litecoin (-2.52%) saw more modest losses on the week. A choppy week saw the total crypto market cap rise from $324bn to a Thursday high $386.6bn before easing back. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $344.83bn. 24-hour trading volumes were also on the up, rising from $70.7bn levels to hit $140bn levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, 24-hour trading volumes stood at $88.43bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 1.88% to $12,144.0. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $11,920 to a high $12,193 before easing back. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed start to the day. Ethereum (+0.71%), EOS (+0.22%), Ripple’s XRP (+0.22%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.66%) were in positive territory. On the slide, however, were Stellar’s Lumen (-1.2%), Litecoin (-0.98%), and Binance Coin (-1.64%). Bitcoin Cash SV was flat with just a 0.05% loss at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $12,000 levels through the morning to support another run at the first major resistance level at $12,390.33. An early move through the morning high $12,193 to $12,200 levels would signal the start of a more material rally on the day. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market for a break out from the first major resistance level. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin will likely come up short of the second major resistance level at $12,860.67. Failure to hold onto $12,000 levels could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall through to $11,850 levels would bring the first major support level at $11,397.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 support levels on the day.

California’s Cannabis Delivery Service Now Accepts Bitcoin," SpeedWeed, California’s only legal cannabis delivery platform, announced that it is now accepting Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Customers can now use the popular cryptocurrency to purchase legal marijuana products from licensed dispensaries and have them delivered directly to their door, the company said in a statement. “With banks and credit card companies shying away from the cannabis industry, customers are forced to pay in cash. That’s really inconvenient. We have a better way,” SpeedWeed Director of Operations Ken Breese stated. “By allowing members to pay with crypto, we’re able to keep our promise: SpeedWeed is the safest, most convenient way to have cannabis delivered.” Launched in 2011 as a family business, SpeedWeed has become the largest cannabis delivery platform in America with over 200,000 members and growing. It gained notoriety for delivering medical marijuana to the homes of some of Hollywood’s biggest stars.

," Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino has teased on Twitter that the popular cryptocurrency exchange will soon offer up to 100x leverage. At the time of writing, the maximum leverage on Bitfinex is set at just 3.3x. By seasoned margin trading standards, 3.3x leverage is quite tame, with popular crypto derivative exchanges like BitMEX building their reputation on the ability to trade up to 100x leverage. At this level of leverage, only a 1% move against you would ‘liquidate’ your position – a level of volatility seen most days in the crypto markets. 👀🦁 pic.twitter.com/kBgPsGyOL3 — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) June 24, 2019  The maximum leverage used when opening a trade typically refers to the leeway you have to lose on a trade before it gets liquidated. For the 3.3x leverage that Bitfinex operates with today, if you used the maximum leverage and opened a margin short or long (without a stop loss), then the trade would typically confiscate all the margin reserved in the trade if the position moves against you by 30%. According to Ardoino, there will be no change to the current margin trading offering, and trading at the maximum leverage will be an “optional instrument” for Bitfinex traders. He said the offering will be isolated in order to mitigate the risks that are associated with ultra-high leverage trading. Traders are able to prevent additional losses by not applying any additional funds from their balance to their margin trading accounts on the Hong Kong-based exchange. The CTO also confirmed that only verified users would be able to use the new feature.

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 02/07/19," Bitcoin saw red for a 3rd consecutive day to kick off the 3rd quarter on the back foot. Bitcoin fell by 1.48% on Monday. Following on from a 9.33% slide on Sunday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,640. A relatively bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $10,641 to an early morning intraday high $11,231. While falling well short of the first major resistance level at $11,806, Bitcoin came up against the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 before hitting reverse. An afternoon sell-off saw Bitcoin slide to an early evening intraday low $10,088 before finding support. The reversal saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level before recovering to $10,600 levels. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of green across the crypto-board. Leading the way on the day was EOS, which rallied by 4.96%. Close behind was Bitcoin Cash ABC, which rose by 4.11%. Binance Coin and Ripple’s XRP also saw solid gains, rising by 3.86% and by 3.49% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.00%), Ethereum (+1.25%), and Stellar’s Lumen (+2.04%) saw more modest gains on the day. With Bitcoin bucking the trend to see red on the day, Bitcoin’s dominance fell back to 60% levels. A choppy day for the crypto majors led the total crypto market cap to sub-$300bn levels before a late recovery. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $303.56bn. Following a bullish month for Bitcoin, the pullback from $12,000 levels to test support at $10,000 will test investor resilience. It wouldn’t be the first time that Bitcoin slid back from a momentum driven rally… At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 3.44% to $10,274.4. An early morning high $10,719 came up short of the first major resistance level at $11,796 before hitting reverse. Bitcoin fell to a morning low $10,263 before steadying. In spite of the pullback, Bitcoin held above the first major support level at $10,075. It was a sea of red across the crypto majors. Litecoin and Binance Coin were alongside Bitcoin at the time of writing. The pair were down by 3.26% and $3.14% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV saw a modest loss of just 0.48% through the early hours. Bitcoin would need to move back through to $10,700 levels to support a broad-based crypto market rebound. A move through to $10,700 levels would bring $11,000 levels into play before any pullback. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level at $11,218 and 23.6% FIB of $11,275 would likely limit any upside. In the event of a rebound, Bitcoin could test the second major resistance level at $11,796 before any pullback. Failure to move back through to $10,700 levels could see Bitcoin struggle through the day. A slide through the morning low $10,263 would bring the first major support level at $10,075 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,000 support levels on the day. In the event of a meltdown, the 38.2% FIB of $9,734 and second major support level at $9,510 should limit the damage.

," At the time of writing, the positive momentum in the cryptocurrency markets is still present. Bitcoin is well on the way to $20,000, and that means we can expect some altcoins to pump higher as well. Bitcoin broke through the $9,000, $10,000, and $11,000 levels with ease last month, but has struggled to consistently remain above $12,000. After hovering close to $14,000, it broke down toward its 20-day EMA, touching the $9,600 level again. We can’t forget that Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset that is helping investors dodge economic and geopolitical risks in the form of trade wars, sluggish GDP growth, and what appears to be a new era of quantitative easing for central banks. For that reason, the coin has emerged as the top-performing asset of 2019, vastly outperforming stocks, bonds, commodities, and government-backed currencies. Plus, Bitcoin’s all-time ROI is now over 6,000%. Another positive price indicator is the fact that gold-bugs and more traditional asset-based investors seem to be turning to Bitcoin as a safe haven from a possible economic meltdown coming at the end of the year or in 2020. The correlation between bitcoin and gold is now the highest its been since 2016. pic.twitter.com/jgO6D2xalE — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) July 3, 2019    Let’s take a look at how the top cryptocurrencies have been performing. Bitcoin is evolving as expected. Its overall value keeps increasing, and if you look at the volumes profile on the left of the graph above, you’ll notice there’s plenty of volume keeping BTC above the critical $11,000 level. My prediction that Bitcoin could hit $20,000 by the end of the year could turn into an “end of the month” kind of deal. Assuming the positive trend continues and BTC price continues to rise, we should expect higher volumes coming in at key levels close to $20,000. Although many retail investors will be looking to sell some of their gains when Bitcoin hits all-time highs again, we can expect the price to keep going at least for a few weeks. However, as the market becomes more liquid, we should expect fewer violent swings, so it could take longer for BTC to reach a new high. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal – not only in shorter time frames but also in daily and weekly ones as well – I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past two weeks, volume has gone from $17 billion to $23 billion, consolidating now around $20 billion. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $15,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Looking at the Ethereum chart above, we can clearly see a couple of interesting features. Firstly, the 20-day EMA has crossed the 50-day EMA, and the latter has crossed the 200-day EMA, which are both quite bullish signals. Price is now also trading well above the 200-day EMA at over $300. Moreover, there could now be new support forming around $305, just above the 200-day EMA. This means the likelihood that price will come crashing down past this level is now lower, and will continue to diminish as long as ETH can hold this key level. For the time being, I expect ETH to maintain its positive momentum, as I don’t see a reason for the positive trend to break. Volume-wise, ETH has been growing steadily and is now close to the $8 billion region. Recent news from the Ethereum Foundation is putting positive pressure on price, as the coin is expected to have at least a testnet of the new Casper PoS models ready by the first half of 2020. With the upcoming Libra project – a currency envisioned by the Facebook team – there will be extra pressure on Ethereum to develop as both have similar goals in terms of smart contract functionality. Ripple (XRP) was experiencing a pretty bullish period until the beginning of July, when price came crashing down below all its EMAs. At the time of writing, XRP is trading close to $0.40 after falling about 20% from its 2019 high north of $0.50. During June, XRP managed to cross the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs as volumes went berserk. I expected support to be around $0.43 and then again at $0.38, where the 200-day EMA is sitting. The $0.43 level of support fell pretty easily, but it seems like $0.38 is holding for now. I’m not entirely sure how price will move from here, but as long as Bitcoin maintains a positive slope, I expect Ripple to regain some of its latest losses. LTC has been consolidating nicely around its 20-day EMA, which is quite an amazing achievement from a coin that was trading at around $30 in January 2019 and peaked at $147 in June. Fundamentals remain strong as LTC’s adoption keeps rising due to small fees and faster block times. Plus, the halvening event is just around the corner, and this usually has a tendency to push price upwards. At the moment, price is trading above $115, and I expect it to continue to rise toward the $130 and $150 levels, where it should find the usual resistance. That is of course assuming Bitcoin maintains its positive trend. If you were one of the smart ones who bought in during the early 2019 dip, congratulations! LTC has been one of the best performing coins in 2019. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently sitting above $407 – almost 20% lower than last month. Bitcoin is still gaining market-share dominance over most coins, including BCH, and BCH price is currently trading at its lowest against BTC since late 2018. However, this doesn’t mean investors won’t take this opportunity to convert BTC into BCH. Bitcoin Cash has broken the major $350 level around its 20-day EMA, and the 50-day EMA has finally crossed the 200-day EMA. Moreover, the trend seems to be quite bullish, even though volumes have shrunk over the past week – like most altcoins. If order books stay on the side of buyers, which will become increasingly difficult the more price goes up, we could see BCH climbing again to $500 and above in just a few weeks. I expect Bitcoin to continue moving in an upwards trajectory with the usual 20-30% dips before we break all-time highs later this year. The major altcoins will follow Bitcoin’s lead as people begin to spread their gains and diversify their portfolios. Will this happen? Or will the market cool off during the summer? Leave your thoughts below. Safe trades! The post Cryptocurrency market update: Altcoins on the rise? appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Pedro Febrero,Coin Rivet,2019-07-08T14:00:05.000Z

Why should I use a Bitcoin mining calculator? Mining Bitcoin used to be a fairly simple process. You could set up a computer to solve complex maths problems and, in return, receive Bitcoin. It was possible to earn Bitcoin quickly just by using the computing power in your home. Now, however, the process has become more complicated. Some people are mining Bitcoin on an almost industrial scale, which makes it difficult for small miners to compete. Without the use of specialised, high-powered machinery, it can be hard to mine profitably on a small scale. As a result, it’s a good idea to work out what your likely profits will be before you get into Bitcoin mining. A Bitcoin mining calculator will help to provide the answer. What details to enter into a Bitcoin mining calculator You can find an array of Bitcoin mining calculators online. There are several parameters you can fill in, and the more information you provide, the more accurate it will be. The information you can enter includes:   Pre-filled information  The calculator will also have some pre-filled sections, which are continually updated. These include:   Calculating the results Once you’ve entered all your mining information, click “calculate” and the results will appear automatically. Some calculators will show your likely profits on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Most display the results in US dollars. Although certain values are pre-entered, such as the current Bitcoin price, some calculators let you change these to simulate potential future scenarios. It’s worth bearing in mind that factors like Bitcoin price and mining difficulty can change rapidly. This means it’s important to ensure you have up-to-date calculations and don’t rely on past results. Each time your electricity costs change, you’ll also need to carry out a fresh calculation. In addition, some calculators don’t take into account upfront costs such as the price of your mining equipment. Setting up a proper mining rig with multiple ASIC miners can cost thousands of dollars. And because miners produce heat, you’ll also need to buy cooling fans to ensure your operation stays efficient (this also uses a lot of electricity). It could take months or even years to break even on your initial investment. Conclusion Mining Bitcoin profitably has become a lot harder in recent times, but it isn’t impossible. You just need to ensure you do your research, have the right hardware, and opt for low electricity costs where possible.

Casa rolls out cryptocurrency mobile app to attract bitcoin novices," Cryptocurrency custody startup Casa has rolled out a new mobile app.  Sats App is a noncustodial wallet that allows users to manage their lightning nodes straight from their mobile phone, CoinDesk writes. Casa is planning to add a rewards program to attract more cryptocurrency early adopters, who can earn cryptocurrency and learn about cryptocurrencies and node management. “Features are focused on increasing adoption of bitcoin and lightning nodes,” said Casa CEO Jeremy Welch. “You will be able to earn bitcoin if you don’t have a Casa node, but you will be able to earn bitcoin faster if you have a node.” The app will currently be available only to Casa customers, with a full roll-out planned for later this month. According to Welch, although the app is “lightweight,” it offers multiple actions — earning sats and operating a full node. “It’s private, secure and connects over Tor,” he added. Earlier this year, Casa announced a “core shift” to its business, launching the Keymaster mobile app and plug-and-play Bitcoin Lightning node Casa Node. ",Carol Gaszcz,The Block,2019-07-03T22:20:18.000Z

Steering well clear of the major support and resistance levels, Bitcoin found support through the afternoon. A late rally saw Bitcoin break through the first major resistance level at $11,290.67 to strike an intraday high and new swing hi $11,369.00. A late pullback left Bitcoin back at sub-$11,000 levels. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red for the major cryptos. Litecoin led the way down on the day, sliding by 3.34%. EOS was close behind, falling by 3.13%. Ethereum saw the most modest losses on the day, falling by 0.49% to hold onto $300 levels. For the week, Litecoin and Stellar’s Lumen saw red, with losses of 0.25% and 0.66% respectively. While Bitcoin led the way with the 21.5% rally, Binance Coin and Ethereum also saw solid gains. The pair ended the week up by 15.4% and by 14.4% respectively. Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash SV also saw double-digit gains on the week. Bitcoin’s trend-bucking move on Sunday led to a further rise in dominance to 59% levels, with a further rise anticipated. Over the course of the week, the total crypto market cap jumped from $285.84bn to $325bn levels on Sunday. 24-hour trading volumes were choppy through the week, however. Volumes fell to $46bn levels on Thursday before recovering to $72bn levels on Sunday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.73% to $10,724.00. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $10,922.00 to a low $10,560.00 before finding support. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin came within range of the first major support level at $10,533.67. Elsewhere, it was red across the crypto-board. Leading the way down was Bitcoin Cash SV, with a 3.96% loss. Stellar’s Lumen continued to struggle, falling by 3.03% Ethereum saw more modest losses early on, down by just 0.78% at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to move through the morning high $10,922.00 to $10,950 levels to support a return to $11,000 levels. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to take a run at the first major resistance level at $11,330.67. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Sunday’s high $11,369 would likely limit any upside on the day. Failure to move through to $10,950 levels could see Bitcoin fall deeper into the red before any recovery. A pullback through the morning low $10,560.00 would likely see Bitcoin fall through the first major support level at $10,533.67. Barring an extended sell-off through the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,400 levels.

Now in its eleventh year, it’s already had a massive impact on how people relate to their personal finances, investing, and digital assets in general. Bitcoin’s wild price swings usually snatch the headlines, but there’s a lot more to Bitcoin than its volatility. So, how does Bitcoin work and why is it so revolutionary? Let’s take a closer look. Bitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency (or cryptocurrency) which has no physical coins or notes. Imagine Bitcoin as a computer file that you store on your desktop or smartphone using an app called a “digital wallet”. You can own one Bitcoin or fractions of a Bitcoin. Each Bitcoin can be divided into units called satoshis (similar to cents for the US dollar). Each satoshi is worth 0.00000001 Bitcoin. Users can keep Bitcoin and satoshis in their digital wallets, as well as sell, buy, and send them to other people. One of the most revered characteristics of Bitcoin is its independence from central banks and governments. But how does Bitcoin work without a central authority to control the transactions? Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain which can’t be tampered with or changed. Transactions are finalised quickly and securely from one peer to another. Everything happens without a third party like banks or other financial institutions. Bitcoin is important for many reasons: as a deflationary currency, an alternative financial system, a payment method, and a store of value to name a few. But it has also gained a lot of traction due to its underlying blockchain technology. Blockchain has the potential to disrupt more than just the financial industry. As its name suggests, you can think of blockchain as a chain of blocks. Each new block added to the chain depends on the previous one. This code makes it impossible for users to modify records without being caught, as any change would alter the network and the block would be rejected. Bitcoin is generated every time a new block is validated and added to the blockchain. It’s a complex process called mining that requires a large amount of computational power. Miners use specific hardware to solve the complex mathematical puzzles necessary to validate blocks and receive Bitcoin in return. The Bitcoin blockchain was built to generate a total of 21 million Bitcoin. This means that only 21 million can ever exist. It cannot be printed like fiat currency and its scarcity increases its value while protecting users against inflation. The origins of Bitcoin are shrouded in mystery, as Bitcoin’s creator has remained anonymous. Officially, the person who designed and wrote the code for Bitcoin is called Satoshi Nakamoto. However, no one knows whether this person exists or whether we’re looking at a group of people. Mr Nakamoto claimed to be a man living in Japan, born on 5th April 1975. However, there’s no proof of his identity. This made many early cryptocurrency adopters believe the creator of Bitcoin was a group of cryptography and IT experts from Europe and the United States. The world first heard of Bitcoin in October 2008 when Nakamoto published his white paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. The document described Bitcoin – the first digital cryptocurrency – and the way it worked. A few months later, in January 2009, Nakamoto released the software necessary for launching the network and mining the first Bitcoin. He was the one to create the first block on the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the Genesis block. The creator of Bitcoin kept working on the project until 2010. Then, he passed the control of the source code to Gavin Andersen and disappeared. This move hasn’t affected the growing popularity of Bitcoin. By the end of that year, the first cryptocurrency exchange was launched. In 2011, Bitcoin reached parity with the USD, but the price didn’t stop there. About the same time, new cryptocurrencies entered the market. In 2014, the BTC price went down by 50% and needed more than two years to recover. It was the first time users had to think seriously about the volatility of cryptocurrencies. The pattern repeated itself in 2017 when the price hit nearly $20,000 for one BTC and plunged down to around $4,000 one year later. Today, Bitcoin continues to be one of the most volatile digital assets on the market. So how does Bitcoin work this out to be used as a form of payment? For now, making instant payments with Bitcoin is still a challenge for many owners. The digital coin remains an asset for long-term investments rather than a payment method for the majority of the Bitcoin community (known as HODLers). How does Bitcoin work? There’s no simple answer to this question. It’s similar to a bank transfer, but with significantly lower fees and the chance of making gains (or losses) on your investment. The good news is that users don’t necessarily need to understand how Bitcoin and the blockchain work to invest in it. However, knowledge about market trends and risk management are certainly helpful if you’re planning to take the plunge.

A look at Bitcoin’s timelocks," One of Bitcoin’s most valuable features is timelocks. The feature, which has existed since the first release of Bitcoin, enables users to create transactions that are invalid (unspendable) until a certain amount of time has passed. In 2015 and 2016, a handful of Bitcoin Core developers introduced more advanced levels of timelocks, enabling users to create timelocks for individual Bitcoin outputs rather than entire transactions. Timelocks also provide the base and infrastructure for a variety of smart contracts and projects built on Bitcoin. Layer two projects like Lightning Network rely heavily on the development of Bitcoin’s timelock features. Companies like Particl also use timelock features to create escrow services for clients.

Bitcoin’s carbon footprint is same as Las Vegas," Bitcoin has a carbon footprint equal to that of Las Vegas, according to scientists. Boffins at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have figured out that the world’s most dominant cryptocurrency is responsible for pumping out around 22 megatons of carbon dioxide every year – the same amount as the infamous US home of 24-hour casinos. Researchers at TUM analysed masses of data such as the IP addresses of Bitcoin ‘miners’ who eat up vast amounts of electricity to harvest pieces of the cryptocurrency. Miners set their machines up to solve various mathematical conundrums in order to execute transactions to be rewarded with Bitcoins, but the cost in electricity to do so can often outweigh the value of the coin itself. This, says the TUM research team in a Coin Rivet article for the Daily Express, poses the question of what effect Bitcoin is having on climate change. Bitcoin accounts for more than half of all the world’s cryptocurrency transactions, meaning the shocking figures produced by the German scientists could easily be doubled. “Bitcoin’s power consumption may only be the tip of the iceberg,” says the report by lead researcher Christian Stoll. “Including estimates for three other cryptocurrencies adds 30 TWh to our annual estimate for Bitcoin. “If we assume correlation to market capitalisation and consider only mineable currencies, this more than doubles the power consumption we estimate for Bitcoin.” The power usage for mining Bitcoin alone is the equivalent of the power output of Sri Lanka, the paper confirms. Stoll concludes: “Participation in the bitcoin blockchain validation process requires specialised hardware and vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant carbon footprint.” It’s a concern that has raised eyebrows within environmental campaign group Greenpeace. “The latest analysis of the energy footprint of Bitcoin reaffirms what has been well documented previously – the energy intensive nature of bitcoin mining is driving significant new demand for electricity, particularly in places like China and Korea that remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels” said Gary Cook, Greenpeace Senior IT Sector Analyst. “If Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hope to maintain their social license in a world that is increasingly driven to action by the Climate Emergency, not only must there be changes to the ‘Proof of Work’ model to make mining far less energy intensive, but mining must also be restricted to locations where mining is powered by renewable sources of electricity, and not driving new demand for fossil fuels.” Is Bitcoin braced for its next bull run? https://coinrivet.com/bitcoin-bull-run-imminent-expert-says/ The post Bitcoin’s carbon footprint is same as Las Vegas appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Darren Parkin,Coin Rivet,2019-06-16T20:25:26.000Z
"Market Morning: Iran Downs Drone, Gold Breaks Through, Mexico Approves USMCA"," The Persian Gulf is Boiling Iran shot down a US drone in the Straits of Hormuz, the narrowest point of the Persian Gulf, the biggest oil shipping lane in the world. The Iran Revolutionary Guards claimed credit for the move, the first time the country has admitted to playing a role in blowing something up belonging to another country since tensions started to rise in the area ever since the Trump Administration reinstituted sanctions against the country. The hit happened in international airspace, which could intensify any excuse to strike back, since the US is allowed to fly drones over international airspace and shooting them down is a technically a “provocation”. The drone was an RQ-4 Global Hawk according to Iran, and a US Navy MQ-4C Triton according to the US. Iran claims it was shot down over Iranian airspace, and the US demurs. Oil is up on the news past $55 a barrel. (NYSEARCA:USO) Gold Breaks Through 5-Year Resistance  Although rates were held steady yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the Federal Reserve clearly signaled to markets that rates would be cut after the next meeting. At least if they aren’t, stocks are going to crash, given the dovish wording and the universally noticed lack of the word “patience” when addressing possible rate cuts in its press statement. In response to this, in addition to the biggest month in terms of government spending in US history, and equal signals of easing coming out of the European Central Bank, gold pushed through 5-year resistance at $1390 last night, hitting a high of $1397, though has since pulled back to the mid-$1380’s. Gold is now up about 9% in a month. (NYSEARCA:GLD) Call the Village People, Mexico Approves the USMCA Mexico approved the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), a rehash of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), except it has the letters that President Trump wants in it instead. The deal was approved by a vote of 114-4, with three abstentions. Apparently, the threat of tariffs against Mexico made 2 weeks ago are now completely forgotten. With Mexico ratifying the agreement, the United States and Canada still have to give it the go-ahead. In order for that to happen, Democrats in the House of Representatives will have to resist the urge to mess up Trump’s plans, a prospect too tantalizing for them to bypass. Blackstone Says that China Trade War Won’t Cause Recession Blackstone (NYSE:BX) CEO Stephen Schwarzman isn’t all that concerned about the trade war with China and doesn’t think that it will cause a recession, though conceding that the whole ordeal is a “high-wire act,” though he seems to think that there are pillows to break the fall if they trip.  “It’s not that big of a game to throw us into recession,” he told CNN Business in an interview. In one sense he may be right, in that the tariffs may not by themselves cause a recession, but if one is already coming, the tariffs will definitely make the situation that much worse. Schwarzman believes that upcoming talks between Trump and Xi, which were confirmed recently, would help reshape the relationship. Blackstone is at all time highs, and if Schwarzman is wrong, that means the stock could take a beating if he is positioning the investment group according to his positive economic outlook. Gundlach Says Trump May Not Run for Reelection If he’s down enough in the polls, he may not run, and he’s pretty down. If the economy goes into the crapper, “…there’s very little for him to run on ,” said the newly crowned “Bond King” Jeffrey Gundlach, who has apparently taken title from Bill Gross, the previous Bond King. Trump is trailing every Democratic candidate currently running, and even struggling to keep Texas, a typical GOP stronghold, against Joe Biden. “I am not even sure he’s going to really run,” said Gundlach to Fox’s Neil Cavouto, hedging his bets and not quite predicting that he will necessarily bow out. However, Trump is known to bail from fights that he thinks he cannot win. If he drops out, Vice President Mike Pence may take the baton, though China would certainly cheer if this were to be the case, since the trade war would quickly evaporate. Deutsche Bank Get Punched in Gut, Again Duetsche Bank (NYSE:DB), not having a particularly good decade, is being investigated yet again for alleged crimes of money laundering. Shares are down 2.2% in the premarket in Germany, though the ADR is trading about 0.9% up in the wee hours in the United States. The situation is a bit complicated by the fact that Deutsche is a big lender to Donald Trump, which probably doesn’t want any more information out about his finances than is already exposed. The stock is skirting all time lows and has already publicized plans to stuff some of its bad assets into a bad bank and get out of the investment banking business, in favor of concentrating on transaction banking. Some of the problematic transactions being investigated have to with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, another thing the President has to worry about. Facebook Libra bad for Bank Stocks Speaking of bad banks, Facebook’s (NASDAQ:FB) new Libra cryptocurrency is particularly bad news for transaction banking, provided that banking regulatory authorities allow the project to go forward. Since the crypto will be backed by a basket of government fiat currencies, the price will be much more stable relative to these currencies than bitcoin (BTC-USD) is currently. Facebook will eventually allow libra to be transferred between people on the social networks, and since the Libra would represent currencies, it can earn a yield, allowing Facebook to become a de facto at much lower transaction costs, displacing the business of many a big bank.

"Cryptocurrency market cap reaches $323 billion; more IEOs to come, report shows"," The value of the cryptocurrency market continues to grow, reaching $323 billion by the end of June 2019, according to a report carried out by PwC and the Crypto Valley Association. In February this year, cryptocurrencies' market cap hit a 21-month low. However, by the end of May, its value had more than doubled and has continued growing since. The ongoing clarification of regulatory frameworks may have contributed to the rising prices of cryptocurrencies, the report suggests. Similarly, the renewed attention from institutional investors and established companies may have also affected the market positively. According to the report, there have been more than 250 token offerings this year, raising a total of $3.3 billion; with Bitfinex’s IEO topping the table. “The development of IEOs has accelerated significantly since the beginning of 2019,” noted Dr. Daniel Diemers, Head of Blockchain EMEA at PwC. “It reflects the creativity and innovative spirit of the crypto industry and shows that the demand for simple and secure solutions is growing. IEOs show that fundraising via cryptocurrencies is becoming more established and striving for greater institutionalization and credibility.”",Carol Gaszcz,The Block,2019-06-27T08:48:46.000Z
$1 billion in crypto will be spent on the dark web this year; but under 1% of all bitcoin transactions – Report," Crypto transactions on the dark web are set to hit a record $1 billion by the end of 2019, Bloomberg writes.  According to research by Chainalysis, crypto usage on the dark web has amounted to a new high of $515 million since the start of the year. Besides bitcoin, Monero is also widely used on the dark web primarily to purchase drugs, child pornography and stolen credit-card information.  Nevertheless, illicit transactions constitute less than 1 per cent of all Bitcoin transactions. This has decreased from the 7 per cent seen in 2012, according to Chainalysis senior product manager of data Hannah Curtis.

Return of the alts: Bitcoin’s dominance falls as altcoins rally," It seems that the long-awaited alt-season may finally have arrived after Bitcoin’s market cap dominance fell from 60% to 55% following strong rallies for a number of prominent altcoins. With Bitcoin’s dominance falling over 2% in the last few days alone, we have seen breakouts for many top-10 market cap projects. Bitcoin SV, for example, is up over 140% in a week, with other large-cap projects like Ethereum and Litecoin up over 22% and 36% respectively. Over the same time period, Bitcoin saw its own breakout to fresh 2019 highs with a comparatively paltry 15% move to the upside. Unconventional industry analyst the Crypto Dog has stated that “we haven’t seen nothing yet” until both ETH and BTC “blow the lid on this flag”. His “I have a bag” hashtag appeared to signify that the technical trader is gearing up to sell off some of his alt collection. For many alt-projects, margin trading is not really an option, so the only way to realise really huge profits would be to ‘buy the dips’ as they come and then plan to sell them off for large gains once the retail investors arrive. #altseason? Nah, we haven't even seen nothin' yet. Once $ETH / $BTC blows the lid on this flag… oof. #ihaveabag pic.twitter.com/rjkWhOSheF — The Crypto Dog📈 (@TheCryptoDog) May 29, 2019  Despite Bitcoin breaking out of its most recent pennant to trade its way up to $9,000, it has since been trading sideways and potentially into a bull-flag formation that is reminiscent of the base it used to spring up from in 2017 – before its year-end parabolic adventure. Unlike Bitcoin however, Ethereum has seen higher highs over the last 24 hours after rallying from its $260 support to now trade at over $280. Litecoin too has smashed through any remaining resistance at $100 to trade up to $120. Traditionally, alt-season usually kicks off with BTC rising first, with money then subsequently flowing downwards through large-cap alt-projects and then into a select group of low market cap ‘decentralised’ projects that only have liquidity with other crypto pairs. Looking at the historical charts for BTC dominance, it’s easy to see that the last time that dominance trended downwards from a similar peak (in December 2017), the move down looked like a parabolic capitulation all the way down to 33%. Chances are we won’t see the same thing play out this time, but if the symbolic 50% dominance fails to hold in the coming weeks, then we may see another shift away from the “It’s only about Bitcoin” narrative that has been building steam in 2019.

1," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook’s first foray into cryptocurrency is coming – first dubbed ‘Facebook Coin’, then ‘Global Coin’, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It’s at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle – the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don’t have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: “The Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.” So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it’s a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn’t allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves. Is there a darker side to Libra? The post Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date? appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Chris Coney,Coin Rivet,2019-07-03T15:00:56.000Z
Cryptocurrency CEO who paid $4.6M for lunch with Buffett: 'It might be unrealistic'," Warren Buffett has called cryptocurrency a “gambling device” with “a lot of fraud,” and declared, “That is not investing.” Justin Sun is going to attempt to change Buffett’s mind. Sun, cofounder and CEO of the cryptocurrency project Tron, bid $4.56 million in the annual eBay charity auction earlier this month to win lunch with Buffett. Sun has not shared when the lunch will take place, but tweeted on Monday that he has confirmed the lunch with Buffett. The location will be Smith & Wollensky in New York City, and Sun can bring seven friends to join. On Monday, Sun told Yahoo Finance his goal for the lunch: “We want this lunch to be a bridge between the cryptocurrency community and the traditional investor.” That’s a tall order. And Sun knows it. “It might be unrealistic to convince Warren Buffett, just in three hours, to buy cryptocurrencies,” Sun says. “But we want to show him the recent progress of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It’s not only about Tron itself, it’s about crypto and blockchain, the whole industry.” Sun adds that he is a “long-time believer” in Buffett’s value investing strategy, and, he says, “I’ve made lots of money from these strategies. So this is like a payback to Warren Buffett.” Sun also liked that the charity, Glide Foundation, is based in San Francisco. But some may find irony in how Sun paid the $4.56 million: with ad revenue from BitTorrent, the peer-to-peer file sharing company Sun bought last year for $140 million. BitTorrent, Sun acknowledges, “has nothing to do with cryptocurrency.” Tron is one of the more controversial of the top crypto projects. It was originally pitched as a blockchain platform for the entertainment industry, but its cryptocurrency Tronix (TRX) is currently mostly used for sports gambling. Sun still says he has clear ambition for Tron: “Our mission is to decentralize the internet.” In addition to running the Tron Foundation, Sun is CEO of Peiwo, a Chinese social platform built around voice recognition. He was also an early investor in Tesla; he drew heavy scrutiny last month when he announced a Tesla giveaway and then appeared to rescind the offer. Sun graduated from Hupan University, the school Alibaba cofounder Jack Ma established in 2015 in Hangzhou, and he calls himself a “protege” of Jack Ma. As of Monday, Tronix is the No. 11 cryptocurrency by market cap. The price is up 55% in 2019, while bitcoin is up more than 100%. — Daniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

Why should I use a Bitcoin mining calculator? Mining Bitcoin used to be a fairly simple process. You could set up a computer to solve complex maths problems and, in return, receive Bitcoin. It was possible to earn Bitcoin quickly just by using the computing power in your home. Now, however, the process has become more complicated. Some people are mining Bitcoin on an almost industrial scale, which makes it difficult for small miners to compete. Without the use of specialised, high-powered machinery, it can be hard to mine profitably on a small scale. As a result, it’s a good idea to work out what your likely profits will be before you get into Bitcoin mining. A Bitcoin mining calculator will help to provide the answer. What details to enter into a Bitcoin mining calculator You can find an array of Bitcoin mining calculators online. There are several parameters you can fill in, and the more information you provide, the more accurate it will be. The information you can enter includes:   Pre-filled information  The calculator will also have some pre-filled sections, which are continually updated. These include:   Calculating the results Once you’ve entered all your mining information, click “calculate” and the results will appear automatically. Some calculators will show your likely profits on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. Most display the results in US dollars. Although certain values are pre-entered, such as the current Bitcoin price, some calculators let you change these to simulate potential future scenarios. It’s worth bearing in mind that factors like Bitcoin price and mining difficulty can change rapidly. This means it’s important to ensure you have up-to-date calculations and don’t rely on past results. Each time your electricity costs change, you’ll also need to carry out a fresh calculation. In addition, some calculators don’t take into account upfront costs such as the price of your mining equipment. Setting up a proper mining rig with multiple ASIC miners can cost thousands of dollars. And because miners produce heat, you’ll also need to buy cooling fans to ensure your operation stays efficient (this also uses a lot of electricity). It could take months or even years to break even on your initial investment. Conclusion Mining Bitcoin profitably has become a lot harder in recent times, but it isn’t impossible. You just need to ensure you do your research, have the right hardware, and opt for low electricity costs where possible.

"Ripple CEO sounds off on Bitcoin, Libra and blockchain balderdash"," Bitcoin and XRP are not competitors, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a Fortune interview this week. The former is a store of value or “digital gold,” while XRP is a “bridge currency” that enables an efficient solution for fiat-to-fiat transfers, he argued. “I own Bitcoin, I’m long Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is a store of value and people hold it.” Garlinghouse went on to state that there will not be one single cryptocurrency to “rule them all”. And he also noted that there is “a lot of bullshit in the blockchain and crypto market.” By way of example, he flagged up a recent CNBC article entitled ‘Facebook Launches Cryptocurrency’. Facebook has done nothing of the sort, Garlinghouse pointed out. Rather the social media giant has announced plans to do so in a year from now. Ripple should be losing sleep over Facebook’s Libra currency as it will do away with the need for hundreds of altcoins, including XRP, according to crypto analyst Max Keiser. In a tweet dated 7th June, he said: “The altcoin apocalypse is nigh. This will drive Bitcoin higher as BTC competes with gold, not fiat”. Crypto payments ventures could also be wiped out, he added. The $FB global stable coin… FaceCoin obviates need for hundreds of alt-cons including XRP. The alt-coin apocalypse is nigh. This will drive Bitcoin higher, as BTC competes with Gold, not fiat.

Button Wallet becomes first company to offer fiat buy-in capability on Telegram," Los Angeles. May 31st — Button Wallet, the Venmo app for cryptocurrency, today announced US customers can use fiat currency to quickly and securely buy digital assets, making Button the first company or bot to enable users to buy-in with fiat on Telegram. Button’s multi-currency crypto wallet is built and comes pre-installed on Telegram messenger. The fiat capability, which makes crypto even more accessible to a larger swath of the population, has been made possible by implementing Wyre technology in a way that has never been done before. Previously, purchasing crypto was confused and time-consuming; it could take up to three weeks for a new user to be verified to purchase crypto with fiat within the US.

May 31st — Button Wallet, the Venmo app for cryptocurrency, today announced US customers can use fiat currency to quickly and securely buy digital assets, making Button the first company or bot to enable users to buy-in with fiat on Telegram. Button’s multi-currency crypto wallet is built and comes pre-installed on Telegram messenger. The fiat capability, which makes crypto even more accessible to a larger swath of the population, has been made possible by implementing Wyre technology in a way that has never been done before. Previously, purchasing crypto was confused and time-consuming; it could take up to three weeks for a new user to be verified to purchase crypto with fiat within the US. With the integration of Wyre into Button Wallet, users in the US can become verified to purchase cryptocurrency with a debit card usually within one hour. “Since launching last year, we rapidly gained over 100,000 users; users who rely on Button Wallet to quickly and easily make payments and split finances using cryptocurrencies,” says Alex Safonov, CEO of Button Wallet. “Letting users buy-in with fiat just as quickly and easily will only make crypto even more appealing and accessible for more people. They will be able to trade BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC, LTC, Waves, Dai and ERC-20 tokens without external fees, and will be able to pay friends and clients alike for everything from freelance gigs to split Coachella expenses.” The addition of Wyre is particularly advantageous to TON investors, as anticipation for the release of TON (Telegram Open Network) grows. Telegram Group recently raised $1.7 billion from private investors to build TON. TON’s cryptocurrency, Gram, will be integrated into Button’s wallet during the third quarter. The Button team has also worked hard to blend Telegram’s KYC process, Telegram Passport, into its ecosystem, making it as simple as possible for users while remaining compliant. Once users create their KYC within Telegram Passport, they don’t need to do it again for any other applications or bots within Telegram. Button is also the only Telegram wallet that doesn’t store user info, passwords, or QR codes. “90% of crypto holders have used Telegram, and Button already created a wallet and exchange right where they are, without requiring external software,” says Rachael McCrary, CCO of Button Wallet. “Now, more Telegram users will be able to get in the game. Once users can buy-in with fiat currency, there are endless possibilities: have a friend pay you in Ethereum and exchange it for Bitcoin, tip someone simply by finding their username in Telegram, and more.” Button, which is based in Moscow and Los Angeles, was developed by a team of hackers who have won countless hackathons around the globe. The Button team was part of the most recent cohort of the Silicon Valley incubator ETC Labs and graduated from accelerators MIT Play Labs and StartupBoost LA. The team has also won 15 engineering awards and hackathons, including ETHSanFrancisco, ETHSingapore and ETHDenver, where they received five nominations (more than any other company). Last week, they attended Consensus and ETHNewYork, winning hacker nominations at the latter from Binance, Matic, and Wyre.

3," Bitcoin has broken $10,000 for the first time in over a year, according to Coin360. Kudos to regular Coin Rivet contributor Jon Walsh for calling this one in early June. Call me mental, but I can feel a sharp parabolic style price increase to $10k for BTC in the next four weeks. Let’s see… — Jon Walsh (@walshjonwalsh) June 4, 2019  At the time of writing, it is up 9.91% on the day and trading at $10,693. And it gets better…’FOMO’ could take Bitcoin from $9,000 to $20,000 within months, Fundstrat Global Advisors Co-founder Tom Lee told CNBC this week. “I think it is easily going to take out its all time highs,” he declared. Not everyone is getting out the party balloons and champagne, however. “I’m still not sold on the idea that it’s up, up, up from here,” says Simon Peters, Analyst at eToro. “We’re due a significant correction still and prices could fall back to as low as $6,500 before the next major rise. That said, you can’t ignore the continuing price surge we’ve seen this year.” As for the latest rise, global politics could be one reason, Peters reckons. “It’s busy out there with the US-China trade war rumbling on, a new Prime Minister on the way in Britain and protests in Hong Kong. Some investors will naturally be spooked and are seeking a safe haven in assets like crypto. Bitcoin’s price may have also been boosted by Tether ‘printing’ another $150 million, which has historically been associated with a bump in crypto prices,” he concludes. George McDonaugh, CEO and Co-Founder of KR1, also advises caution, “On the long way up to $20,000 there were five moments where there was a 40% decrease in price. These shake-outs test your staying power and many new entrants will hand their precious coins back to the market,” he says. “We will see huge corrections again, and passing 10k may well be the catalyst that drives us back down, but whatever happens, we’ve been clearly shown that the interest, adoption and money has not in any way left this new asset class.” The post Bitcoin hits $10,000 and heads for all time highs appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Scott Thompson,Coin Rivet,2019-06-22T07:00:17.000Z
The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 27/06/19," It was another day for the Bitcoin bulls. Bitcoin rallied by 9.7% on Wednesday. Following on from a 6.03% gain on Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $12,876. It was a 9th consecutive day of gains for the Bitcoin bulls. Bullish through most of the day, Bitcoin rallied from an early intraday low $11,684.5 to a late intraday high and new swing hi $13,764. Steering well clear of the major support levels, Bitcoin broke through the major resistance levels before a late sell-off. The late sell-off saw Bitcoin slide back to $11,780 levels before bouncing back. A late recovery saw Bitcoin break back through to $12,000 levels to close out the day with solid gains. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was another mixed bag for the rest of the pack. Joining Bitcoin in the green on the day were Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash ABC, with gains of 5.77% and 1.90% respectively. It was red for the rest of the top 10. Leading the way down were Bitcoin Cash SV and EOS. The pair fell by 7.93% and 6.04% respectively. Litecoin and Stellar’s Lumen also saw relatively heavy losses, falling by 3.6% and by 2.35% respectively. Ripple’s XRP and Binance Coin saw more modest losses of 1.27% and 0.95% respectively. The moves through Tuesday saw Bitcoin’s dominance hit 63% levels. Bitcoin drove the total crypto market cap to $370bn levels on the day, up from $336.68bn on Tuesday. The Bitcoin rally also drew in sidelined investors. 24-hour trading volumes jumped from $71bn levels to $130bn levels on the day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 2.45% to $12,561.0. A choppy start to the day saw Bitcoin hit a morning high $13,242 before sliding to a morning low $12,371. In spite of the choppy start, Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. Elsewhere, it was a sea of red across the majors. Stellar’s Lumen was down by 3.54% at the time of writing. Bitcoin Cash ABC (-2.52%), Binance Coin (-2.77%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (-2.04%) were also deep in the red. Through the early hours, Ethereum saw the most modest of losses, down by 1.25%. Bitcoin would need to move back through to $12,780 levels to support another break through to $13,000 levels. Following the recent string of gains, however, Bitcoin would need support from the broader market to break out from this morning’s high $13,242. Barring a return to $13,000 levels by the early afternoon, Bitcoin would likely come up short of the first major resistance level at $13,865.17. Failure to move back through to $12,780 levels could see Bitcoin fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $12,371 would bring sub-$12,000 levels into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, however, the first major support level at $11,785.67 should limit the downside on the day.

Five reasons this Bitcoin bull run could stomp all over 2017," When the price of Bitcoin tore its way to almost $20,000 in December 2017, the bull run was fuelled mainly by retail FOMO. Hardly anyone buying it knew what it was or how it worked. They just saw it rising in value and making a lot of people rich overnight. But Bitcoin wasn’t ready for wide adoption. Transactions were bottlenecked, fees were high, scams were abundant, and the legal panorama was fuzzy at best. However, a lot has changed since then. Here are at least five reasons the Bitcoin bull run is different from 2017. I received an email yesterday with a report from SFOX – an institutional crypto assets dealer – revealing why Bitcoin’s current $11,000 is different from 2017. Today, it’s heading for $13,000, and who knows what tomorrow will bring? While it looks like analyst Tom Lee may have been right predicting that retail FOMO would kick in at over $10,000, this new Bitcoin bull run is far more likely to last longer. Actually the point of the chart is to say “real FOMO” probably starts when #bitcoin exceeds $10,000 as that is a price level only seen 3% of all days… …mathematically equivalent to exceeding $BTC $4,500 in 2017 Looking back, that price was a level that indeed triggered FOMO — Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 29, 2019  The industry is so much better placed than it was in 2017. Throughout the bear market, Bitcoin has been building. Usage is up, as is transaction speed, hash rate, and block sizes. These are all key for onboarding more users without the issues suffered a year and a half ago. Better than that, transaction fees are down by 68%. Bitcoin first hit $9,000 USD on Nov 27, 2017. Now that Bitcoin is back at $9,000, what has changed? pic.twitter.com/TY5RMQecES — Kevin Rooke (@kerooke) June 17, 2019  You may notice that payments and volume are down as well. But these are key indicators that Bitcoin has transformed from a payment system to a store of value. More people are HODLing than before, and there ain’t no one buying a pizza with BTC. In 2017, cryptocurrency was still being referred to as the “Wild West”. When people heard the word Bitcoin for the first time, their minds often leapt to the dark web, hackers, or clandestine dealings. Bitcoin had yet to receive the official nod from the US SEC that it was not considered a security under its draconian laws. And people were being conned out of their funds left, right, and centre. It’s true that you still have to be careful out there. In the first quarter of 2019 alone, already more than $1.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency has been stolen through fraud. However, security has improved greatly, usability is better, people are taking more time to educate themselves, and Bitcoin is finally casting aside its connotations of criminal deeds. In 2017, big businesses were staying away from Bitcoin, with the notable exception of Microsoft and a handful of others. We had the head of JP Morgan Jamie Dimon calling Bitcoin “stupid” and all large banks urging customers to stay away. In 2019, JP Morgan has its own cryptocurrency (if you want to call it that) and, rather than just accepting payments in Bitcoin, Microsoft is now building on the Bitcoin blockchain. Then there’s Whole Foods, eBay, and, of course, Facebook. SFOX states:  “The current rally corresponds with at least two major news items for retail and institutional investors: details of Facebook’s crypto project, Libra, and BTC mining company Bitmain’s pursuit of a US IPO. This is the kind of validation for the sector that was largely hypothetical back in 2017.”  “The current rally corresponds with at least two major news items for retail and institutional investors: details of Facebook’s crypto project, Libra, and BTC mining company Bitmain’s pursuit of a US IPO. This is the kind of validation for the sector that was largely hypothetical back in 2017.” Just like big businesses, in 2017, institutions were still looking on at this whole new asset class with a mix of awe and caution. Today, accredited investors and institutions are getting in at a premium. They’re literally scrambling to scoop up Bitcoin before it’s too late. In other words, institutions are FOMO-ing in. Bitcoin is trading at over $11,000 on Bitcoin Invesment Trust (GBTC) with a 37% premium over exchanges. AUM of GBTC alone surpassed $1.2 billion this week. Seems like a strong indicator of a rise in interest from accredited and institutional investors. @barrysilbert pic.twitter.com/SU87zuetch — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 29, 2019  In 2017, we had CBOE and CME about to launch their Bitcoin futures products, several hedge funds, and a few blockchain investment firms, but zero major names. Now, firms like Fidelity are storing Bitcoin, Bakkt is entering the space at some point, and major firms like TD Ameritrade are trading it. This Bitcoin bull run is nothing like the last and could have real legs. Bitcoin has now overcome the first hurdle, which was the SEC stating that it was not under its purvue. Yet meaningful regulation has yet to take shape in most corners of the world. However, there are countries like Malta and states like Wyoming blazing the trail as Bitcoin and blockchain-friendly. The conversation about this digital asset has extended beyond dinner parties all the way up to the US Congress. Democratic party presidential candidate hopeful Andrew Yang has even pledged to push through the Token Taxonomy Act in the US if he gets voted in. This will exempt many cryptocurrencies from being labelled securities in the United States. While there are never any certainties when it comes to investing, be it the stock market or cryptocurrencies, this wild price run is definitely different from that of 2017. Bitcoin has done a lot of growing up since then, and the dialogue has reached the highest places. Major corporations are entering the space, institutions are racing to get in on the action, and now it seems that retail traders are interested once more to see just how high this could go.

1," How to Buy Monero’s XMR Monero’s XMR rallied by 4.61% on Thursday.  Following on from a 3.95% gain from Wednesday, Monero’s XMR ended the day at $105.24. A bullish morning saw Monero’s XMR rally from an early intraday low $100.16 to a late morning high $107.0. Steering clear of the major support levels, Monero’s XMR broke through the first major resistance level at $103.12 and second major resistance level at $105.90. A late morning pullback saw Monero’s XMR fall back to $100 levels before rallying to a late intraday high $108.99. Monero’s XMR managed to break back through the first and second major resistance levels before easing back through the second major resistance level. Of greater significance on the day was a hold above the 23.6% FIB of $99. For Monero’s XMR, the extended bearish trend formed at late April 2018’s swing hi $298 remained intact. Monero’s XMR continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $137, following 15th December’s swing lo $37.18. For the bulls, this week’s breakthrough to $100 levels continues to support a run at $140 levels. A move through the 38.2% FIB would see Monero’s XMR form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Monero’s XMR was up by 2.61% to $107.99. A particularly bullish start to the day saw Monero’s XMR rally from a morning low $105.3 to a high $108.41. In spite of the early breakout, Monero’s XMR came up short of the first major resistance level at $109.43. A move back through the morning high $108.41 would give Monero’s XMR another run at $109 levels later in the day. Monero’s XMR would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $109.43. In the event of a broad-based rally, Monero’s XMR could strike $110 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the morning high $108.41 could see Monero’s XMR cough up some of the morning gains. A fall through $104.80 levels would bring the first major support level at $100.60 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Monero’s XMR would likely steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $99 on the day. Major Support Level: $100.60 Major Resistance Level: $109.43 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $99 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $137 62% FIB Retracement Level: $198 Please let us know what you think in the comments below.

The Crypto Week – Bitcoin Leads the Way as Volatility Grips the Majors," While the Bitcoin bulls maintained control, it has been a mixed week for the rest of the pack. Bitcoin fell by 3.38% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 10.18% rally from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,920. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide from an intraday high $12,338 to an early morning intraday low $11,354. Bitcoin steered clear of the first major support level at $11,285.67 and the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 before finding support. Recovering through the remainder of the day, Bitcoin moved back through to $12,000 levels before a late pullback. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 9.3%, which came off the back of 4 days in the green out of the last 6. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a bullish start to the weekend, leaving Bitcoin to buck the trend on the day. Across the rest of the majors, Litecoin led the way, rallying by 11.6% to reverse most of a Thursday 12.6% sell-off. Stellar’s Lumen (+3.87%), EOS (+2.59%), and Ethereum (+2.46%) saw solid gains on the day. For the current week, Bitcoin led the way with its 9.3% rally, Monday through Saturday. Stellar’s Lumen and Ethereum were also in the green for the current week, with gains of 8% and 3.3% respectively. The rest of the pack were in the red, however, with a broad-based crypto sell-off doing the damage on Thursday. Leading the way down was EOS, which tumbled by 13%. Bitcoin Cash SV and Ripple’s XRP also saw heavy losses, with declines of 10.2% and 9.4% respectively. Bitcoin Cash ABC (-6.34%), Binance Coin (-4.35%) and Litecoin (-2.52%) saw more modest losses on the week. A choppy week saw the total crypto market cap rise from $324bn to a Thursday high $386.6bn before easing back. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $344.83bn. 24-hour trading volumes were also on the up, rising from $70.7bn levels to hit $140bn levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, 24-hour trading volumes stood at $88.43bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 1.88% to $12,144.0. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $11,920 to a high $12,193 before easing back. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed start to the day. Ethereum (+0.71%), EOS (+0.22%), Ripple’s XRP (+0.22%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.66%) were in positive territory. On the slide, however, were Stellar’s Lumen (-1.2%), Litecoin (-0.98%), and Binance Coin (-1.64%). Bitcoin Cash SV was flat with just a 0.05% loss at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $12,000 levels through the morning to support another run at the first major resistance level at $12,390.33. An early move through the morning high $12,193 to $12,200 levels would signal the start of a more material rally on the day. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market for a break out from the first major resistance level. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin will likely come up short of the second major resistance level at $12,860.67. Failure to hold onto $12,000 levels could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall through to $11,850 levels would bring the first major support level at $11,397.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 support levels on the day.

6," On Tuesday, money-transfer company MoneyGram saw its stock soar an eye-popping 168% after banking software company Ripple announced it will buy $30 million of MoneyGram shares at a huge premium of $4.10 per share, with the option to buy another $20 million worth of shares over the next two years. In return, MoneyGram (MGI) has made Ripple its primary partner for cross-border payment settlement using digital assets. Suddenly, crypto looks cool again. After the massive run-up in price of all the top cryptocurrencies in 2017, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and ripple (XRP), prices plunged across the board in 2018. Now, halfway through 2019, coins are up and excitement is returning, although the top cryptocurrencies have also appeared to decouple more than in the past—bitcoin is up far more than anything else. Bitcoin is up 140% this year so far; ether is up 87%, and XRP is up 17%. The fact that a partnership and investment from Ripple had the power to send MoneyGram up a staggering 168% on Tuesday is a sign of bullishness for the space. (By Wednesday morning in premarket, shares of MoneyGram were beginning to fall back to earth, but the point was made.) And Ripple’s announcement of its MoneyGram deal came just one day before Facebook’s announcement of Calibra, its first crypto wallet, to store and send Libra, a new cryptocurrency supported by Facebook, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, Uber, Lyft, eBay, Spotify, and more. It all adds up to hot crypto action involving publicly-traded, household-name companies, still a rare thing for an industry whose biggest players are private startups like Coinbase. Ripple sells software to banks and financial institutions for faster settling of cross-border payments. Its two main products are called xCurrent and xRapid, and the xRapid product relies on the cryptocurrency XRP. Ripple, the company, and XRP, the asset, are separate things, but they are often conflated, particularly since Ripple owns 60% of the supply of XRP tokens, which leads cryptocurrency purists to argue that XRP is not sufficiently decentralized as bitcoin is. As a result, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Yahoo Finance on stage at the All Markets Summit: Crypto last year, “There’s a lot of FUD about XRP.” (FUD is fear, uncertainty, and doubt.) Ripple’s former chief market strategist Cory Johnson also identified to Yahoo Finance last year the “religious-like fervor” around XRP. Over the past couple years, Ripple has steadily added a large number of banking clients, but most are using xCurrent, not the product that runs on XRP. Last year, Western Union said it was testing out xRapid, which was taken as a big win for both Ripple and XRP. The deal with MoneyGram will “focus” on xRapid, Ripple says. The company, in its announcement, is touting that XRP “remains the most efficient digital asset for settlement, with transaction fees at just fractions of a penny, compared to other digital asset fees of about $30 per transaction.” — Daniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

Coin Metrics report: Blockchain activity shows Kik’s claim that Kin is more widely used than Bitcoin or Ethereum is inaccurate," Cryptoasset data provider Coin Metrics has released a report showing Kik's claims about its level of blockchain activity and adoption rates for its cryptocurrency Kin are inaccurate. The report, titled: “An Analysis of Kin’s On-Chain Activity” was released today. It analyzed Kin’s blockchain activity to address two specific claims made by Kik on its usage: To analyze Kin’s on-chain activity, Coin Metrics first notes that because Kin has gone through multiple infrastructure changes (there are three versions of the Kin blockchain since launch), the firm will only analyze data from Kin 2 and Kin 3. Kin 2 is a centralized version of Kin’s blockchain designed to be a mid-point for fully transitioning to Kin 3, a blockchain forked from the Stellar protocol. According to Coin Metrics, due to their infancy, blockchains do not share the same level of standardization as traditional applications for estimating activity, such as daily active users. As such, Coin Metrics addresses blockchain activity using two criteria: Operations Count (which Kin uses as evidence to support its claims of activity) and Transfer value. Operations Count Kik defines blockchain activity as “the number of operations on the blockchain in the last 24 hours.” According to Coin Metrics, there are two distinct operations that happen on Kin’s blockchain: payments and account creation. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, account creation is recorded as blockchain activity on Kin 3. As such, blockchain data shows that over the past three months, 36% of Kin 2 operations and 72% of Kin 3 operations have been account creations. And while account creation on Kin could be a good gauge for blockchain activity, Coin Metrics notes that Kin’s blockchain does not require a minimum account balance even though Stellar, the blockchain from which Kin is forking its code, requires a “base reserve” to “prevent empty addresses from bloating the blockchain.” Therefore, Kin accounts can remain empty indefinitely. In fact, roughly 93% of all Kin accounts are empty. Transfer Value Because low-fee blockchains like Kin are inexpensive to transfer transactions on, transfer value, according to Coin Metrics, “is often quite noisy.” An example of “noise,” is if a user moves money between different accounts they own. Coin Metrics has devised an “adjusted transfer value” metric, to remove what it deems noise and spammy behavior. This resulted in the following conclusions: For the first claim, Coin Metrics concludes that, by its nature, a microtransaction platform like Kin will have more transactions with smaller amounts. However, this blockchain activity is ultimately up to how one defines it. If activity were to be measured by payments count, Kin would be considered the most active blockchain. If measured by transfer value, Kin would be considered the least active. According to Coin Metrics, while traditional applications use personal information to identify unique users, blockchains only have addresses, which makes it difficult to determine how many individuals are actually using a blockchain. For its analysis, Coin Metrics uses “active addresses” to address Claim 2. Because Claim 2 is about the number of spenders and earners on Kin, Coin Metrics filtered its data to focus on addresses making payments on Kin’s blockchain. They conclude that: Coin Metrics also adds that, at its peak, there have only been roughly 35,000 Kin addresses with more than 10,000 Kin ($0.23 at time of writing). “This is orders of magnitude less than other blockchains in our sample, which each have at least 1,000,000 addresses that hold at least $1 USD,” Coin Metrics concludes. For Claim 2, Coin Metrics concludes that “although Kin has a relatively high number of active addresses, it has a relatively low amount of addresses with a significant account balance,” and that user comparisons across chains are tricky because they have different use cases and operating costs.",Steven Zheng,The Block,2019-06-24T15:22:15.000Z
"Bitfinex is looking to launch Tether on the Lightning Network by the end of the year, and an exec says it’s ‘one of the coolest things’ they’ve ever done"," As the stablecoin wars continue to heat up, Bitfinex is looking to bring USDT to more blockchains, announcing earlier today that it will launch its stablecoin on EOS's blockchain. Currently, Tether is issued on the Omni Layer, Ethereum, and TRON. In the next couple of weeks, the company is also planning to issue USDT on Blockstream's federated sidechain Liquid. But chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino told The Block that the firm has ambitions to bring the stablecoin to other blockchains, saying that it will launch the coin on Lightning Network sometime this year. As part of those efforts, Bitfinex has joined a group of developers and companies called RGB, which is working to put more assets on the Lightning Network.  Lightning Network is a layer-two protocol that aims to enable quicker and cheaper bitcoin transactions.  ""I think that is one of the coolest things we could ever being [sic] involved with,"" Ardoino said in an email to The Block. ""We really love LN (I personally do a lot) so we want to make sure we learn and contribute to it with our resources,"" he added. Bitfinex has long had intentions to launch of Lightning Network, according to a company update dated September 2017. Implementing tether on Lightning Network could possibly improve the speed of transacting with the coin, the firm has said. ""We are excited to announce the initial discovery and integration discussion with the Lightning Network team for low-cost, instant transactions of Tether currencies on the Lightning Network,"" according to the update. Tether would be the first mainstream asset to be issued on the Lightning Network, which could help the second layer protocol in furthering its adoption. Tether's competitors, USD Coin, TrueUSD, PAX, Gemini dollar are all issued exclusively on Ethereum. Bitfinex and Tether, its affiliated firm that manages its stablecoin USDT, has been embroiled in a dispute with the New York Attorney General's office over the co-mingling of funds. Still, its market capitalization, which took a beating after the NYAG imbroglio, has recouped its losses, hitting a new high above $3.1 billion.  Tether isn't alone is hitting new highs. Elsewhere, PAX has picked up slightly under $70 million in additional market cap over the last month. Meanwhile, USDC has increased by $100 million over the same time period.",Frank Chaparro,The Block,2019-05-31T20:39:08.000Z
," The Bears fought back at the end of the month. Bitcoin slid by 9.33% on Sunday. Following on from a 3.38% loss on Saturday, Bitcoin ended the week down 0.92% at $10,809. The Sunday reversal left Bitcoin up 26.7% for the month of June. Range-bound through the early hours, Bitcoin struck an early intraday high $12,234 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,390.33, Bitcoin slid to a late afternoon low $10,889. The sell-off saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level at $11,397.33 and 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Coming within range of the second major support level at $10,874.67, Bitcoin recovered to $11,400 levels before sliding back. The late pullback saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level, 23.6% FIB, and second major support level at $10,874.67 to an intraday low $10,668. The Sunday sell-off saw Bitcoin’s market cap fall back to sub-$200bn levels after having hit a June high $245.13bn on Thursday. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red across the crypto-board. Bitcoin Cash ABC led the way down on the day, sliding by 10.4%. The rest of the majors were close behind, however. Binance Coin fell by 9.9%, with Bitcoin Cash SV falling by 9.1%. Things were not much better for Stellar’s Lumen (-8.87%), EOS (-8.85%), Litecoin (-8.4%) and Ethereum (-8.31%). The best performer on the day was Ripple’s XRP, which fell by just 7.43%. For the week, EOS led the way down, sliding by 20.76%. Bitcoin Cash SV (-18.39%), Ripple’s XRP (-16.19%), Binance Coin (-13.81%) and Litecoin (-10.68%) all saw heavy losses. Bucking the trend was Stellar’s Lumen that gained 7.19%. In spite of the weekly gain, Stellar’s Lumen ended the month of June with a 20.7% loss. Joining Stellar’s Lumen in the red for June were EOS (-32.42%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (-10.5%), Ripple’s XRP (-9.88%) and Binance Coin (-2.86%). Bucking the trend in June, alongside Bitcoin, were Ethereum (+8.6%) and Litecoin (+6.65%). The moves through Sunday saw Bitcoin’s dominance fall back to 61% levels. Sunday’s reversal left the total crypto market cap at $324.83bn, down from Thursday’s high $386.7bn. In spite of the $60bn drop, the market cap remained well above $273bn levels seen at the start of the month. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 1.49% to $10,970. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $10,641 to a high $11,123 before easing back. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on, while also falling short of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, it was green across the crypto-board, with Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash SV leading the way. The pair were up by 3.07% and by 2.83% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the morning high $11,123 to break through the 23.6% FIB to restore confidence. A move through the 23.6% FIB would bring the first major resistance level at $11,806 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at $12,000 levels. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall through the morning low $10,641 would bring the first major support level at $10,240 into play. Barring another crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,000 support levels.

Bitcoin Tech Analysis – Recap and Mid-Day Review – 08/07/19," Bitcoin rose by 1.85% on Sunday. Following on from a 2.56% gain on Saturday, Bitcoin ended the week up 6.34% to $11,485. On the day, a relatively range-bound morning saw Bitcoin fall to an intraday low $11,110 before finding support. The pullback saw Bitcoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 before recovering to $11,300 levels. A second pullback in the afternoon, saw Bitcoin fall back through the 23.6% FIB before striking an intraday high $11,620. On the day, while Bitcoin fell short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin’s move back through the 23.6% FIB was key. The bullish end to the week contributed to yet another weekly gain and there have been numerous since the start of the year. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin has seen just 8 weeks in the red, which has given Bitcoin a 200% gain year-to-date. All of this in spite of a pullback from 26th June’s current year high $13,764. Bitcoin’s dominance held onto 62% levels. Bitcoin’s market cap has also found support, recovering from sub-$200bn levels on Sunday to $211.17bn at the time of writing. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December’s swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin has continued to find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 3.49% to $11,886.0. Range-bound through the early morning, Bitcoin fell from a start of a day $11,547 to a morning low $11,310 before making a move. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and the first major support level at $11,190, Bitcoin rallied to a late morning high $12,040. Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $11,700 and second major resistance level at $11,915 to hit $12,000 levels before easing back. A hold above the first major resistance level at $11,700 would support another break through the second major resistance level at $11,915. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high $12,040. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin would likely come up short of the third major resistance level at $12,425. In the event of a crypto rally, expect Bitcoin to take a run at $13,000 levels. This morning’s divergence has set the bulls up for a big afternoon if the rest the majors can recover. Failure to hold above the first major resistance level at $11,700 would see Bitcoin cough up the morning gain. A pullback through to sub-$11,400 levels would bring the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, we would expect Bitcoin to steer clear of the first major support level at $11,190. In the event of a meltdown, sub-$11,000 support levels could come into play before any recovery. We would expect the second major support level at $10,895 to limit any downside in the event of a sell-off.

," A recent breakout in the price of gold has gold bugs excited. Source: Jeremy Vohwinkle via Flickr (Modified) The price has shot up $40 per ounce in the last week, from less than $1,280 to almost $1,320 per ounce. “Global tensions bolster safe-haven demand,” is the kind of headline that is going to get aficionados of gold stocks very excited. But this is a debate the other “money is just a construct, man” fans, the bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) bugs, very much want to have. That’s because the price of bitcoin, relative to gold, has shot up in 2019. You could buy a bitcoin with just 3 ounces of gold at the start of the year. It now costs 6.5 ounces. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Thus, gold bug Peter Schiff was walking into a trap when he agreed to debate bitcoin advocate Barry Silbert at a recent SALT conference in Las Vegas. Bitcoin fans had a field day. But did either side have a point? The serious question was, what’s money? The serious answer is that money is whatever you say it is. Money is used to exchange real value, to arbitrate between, say, stories written by this writer and the good people at InvestorPlace. It’s more a verb than a noun. What you want out of money is stability. If you’re shipping a tanker of oil across the seas so you can refine and burn it, you want the value of that oil to be the same on both ends of the voyage. In those terms, neither gold nor bitcoin is money. The price of gold peaked in 2011 at $18,000 and crashed in 2013 to its present trading range. It remains volatile. Bitcoin, meanwhile, zoomed to $20,000 in 2017, crashed to $3,200 late in 2018 and recently traded at $8,500. Gold and bitcoin, in other words, are both speculative assets, not money, because they don’t offer the stability of money. The question then becomes which is more useful and when? Schiff argued that because central banks buy gold and don’t buy Bitcoin that gold is money. Money was once backed by gold and was defined as gold. When everything else crashes it could happen again. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad agrees. He wants Asian countries to create a pan-Asian currency backed by gold because, he says, gold’s value is more stable. Silbert, CEO of Greyscale Investment, argued that bitcoin is better because it’s useful. Thousands of jobs are being created in blockchain start-ups. Bitcoin’s price has proven its resiliency. As money becomes electronic, bitcoin’s value can only grow, he argued. What Schiff and Silbert agreed on is that “fiat currency,” the kind endorsed by central banks, is the riskier bet. Fear sells gold and fear is also propelling bitcoin. Fears of a trade war, of governments using their currencies as a weapon in that war, is propelling both assets. If bitcoin were to hit $50,000, as some crypto-bulls predict, it would prove bitcoin isn’t money, because money’s value lies in its stability. Bitcoin advocates have yet to answer for things like flash crashes, thieves, the shut-down of exchanges, and all the other scams that remain prevalent in their crypto world. Bitcoin bulls insist their asset is an alternative to government control. That means there’s no cop you can turn to when you’re robbed. In the end, the asset you choose to hoard is the one that’s right for you. You can buy rights to gold and move with those rights, but you need to trust the vault owner. You can buy bitcoin and learn to trust the exchange. Everything carries risk. Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

"Can Bitcoin hit $20,000 by January 2020?"," Bitcoin has experienced a major rally that has taken its price upwards close to 34% over the past two weeks. Even with minor retracements, the market is moving positively with higher lows each time it falls, meaning we should expect BTC to continue its climb towards $13,000 – which in my opinion might come within the next couple of weeks. While I personally am still bullish, others are predicting a sudden correction. Just a few days ago, in my weekly Bitcoin price analysis piece, I brought up a hypothesis that all bull markets are expected to suffer large corrections of around 30-35% in the early stages. This means we could still see Bitcoin touching its 100-day EMA or even its 200-day EMA despite the bull cycle (which can last a couple of years). Now, another interesting question many people are asking is when will Bitcoin hit $20,000? Something I usually don’t do – maybe only in the shadows – is making price predictions. I have confidence in my long-term analysis, but I see myself more of an investor than a trader. I only care about really long-term price, not short-term price. I don’t think the current or near-term price of Bitcoin to represent how much its worth. In other words, I do not intend to use BTC as a currency on the foreseeable future. Still, as the market has finally recovered (I believe), it’s now time to see where things could be heading up to the end of the year. Will the summer be kind to Bitcoin? Will we see a massive retracement back to the 20-day EMA or will Bitcoin continue to moon to new yearly highs? Looking at the chart above, it’s easy to guess what I think will happen. As long as that green line stays intact and price manages to stay above it, I expect Bitcoin to continue pushing higher and higher. You can see from the chart that the 50-day EMA has crossed the 100-day EMA, and the 20-day EMA is already above both of them. This means we’re clearly in bullish territory. Moreover, Fibonacci levels show BTC is already holding on to the 0.5 retracement level. The next one will be the key 0.618 level, around $13,500. If Bitcoin manages to surpass this level and get to the 0.786 retracement level, going higher than $16,000, I see little reason for a major retracement back to $8,000 or so. Sure, we can expect BTC to hit key support levels along the way, but the trend line is on quite a positive slope. And as they say, you should never go against the trend – just ride it for as long as possible. New trend-line BTC hitting 20k by Jan 2020 – #BTCUSD chart https://t.co/CkRQcB3s5d — Pedro Febrero (@Febrocas) June 25, 2019  This tweet might come back to bite me. However, I’m true to my analysis. I believe Bitcoin will hit $20,000 before 2020, or during January 2020. If you inspect the chart closely, you’ll see there’s a little tunnel connecting the lows of 2018 with the highs of 2017, which by chance of the mighty trading gods happens to cross exactly over early January 2020. What I think this means is that there will be a huge push towards new highs during the New Year. More adoption, more institutional investors, and a further push for Lightning and lower transaction fees will help Bitcoin’s price maintain its positive slope. Additionally, we shouldn’t forget Bitcoin is a living organism. Through the implementation of Segwit, Signature Aggregation, Taproot, Graftroot, and Scriptless Scripts (smart contracts on the Bitcoin network), we can expect the king of cryptocurrencies to become even more resilient and easy to use. Of course, my analysis could be entirely wrong, but I intend to keep checking how my trend line is holding up. Again, if Bitcoin is able to keep pushing forward, my bet is on a $20,000 Bitcoin by 2020. Wouldn’t that be the cherry on top of the cake? Safe trades!

2," Bitcoin may finally be back in a confirmed bull market after experiencing huge volatility as it looks to find support around $12,000. Following a near four-fold valuation increase since its bear market lows of late 2018, the digital asset hit nearly $14,000 yesterday before the market traded down more than $2,000 to $11,800 and then $11,400 this morning. First network effect: speculation. Human behavior very difficult to change. Bitcoin acts like both Giffin (TX fees) & Veblen (SOV) goods. Time to buy $BTC is @TIPMayerMultple less than 0.8. Now 2.4. Only few months ago Mayer Multiple of 0.5-0.65. Easy peasy. Got #Bitcoin? 😎 pic.twitter.com/yG0sGTyssO — Trace Mayer (@TraceMayer) June 27, 2019  After the initial sell-off, Bitcoin recovered over $1,500 to trade as high as $13,300 before falling back down for its first clear ‘lower low’ in over a week. The second push down seemed to have less momentum and the market has since bounced back above the significant level of $12,000. The move up was driven by spectacular trading volume, with Messari recording over $5.5 billion on its ‘Real 10’ index. Margin trading platform BitMEX also saw record highs with over $11 billion traded on its XBT/USD perpetual swap contract, which is currently holding over $1 billion in open interest and charging funding of up to 1% a day. XBTUSD perp swap open interest is now in the 3 comma club. Welcome to the 2019 bull fucking market YeeHaw! pic.twitter.com/rLhKRIn83d — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 26, 2019  Bitcoin’s market dominance is also up to 62% – a level last seen at the pinnacle of its 2017 bull run to $20,000. After smashing through initially $10,000 and then $12,000 at the first time of asking, Bitcoin made potentially its first FOMO high of its newly established bull market since bottoming in December of last year at $3,100. Following this latest parabolic run of nearly $5,000 (from $9,000 to $14,000), the world’s biggest digital asset has fallen back to see if new buyers can provide support to sustain a five-figure valuation. Looking at the 12-hour chart, we can see potential short-term indecision forming a ‘Neutral-Doji‘ candle. Before the FOMO top, Bitcoin established a run of seven consecutive green 12-hourly candles, with just three red periods over an eight-day parabolic run of 55% gains. Bitcoin is currently trying to establish support at a level of resistance that has rejected a Bitcoin bull market twice – in February and March of 2018. During this time, Bitcoin made a sequence of lower highs of first $11,771 and then $11,683 a few weeks later before heading into a 10-month period of lower highs and continuous retesting of support around $6,000. The support famously broke down to confirm the bear market in November 2018. Since then, many altcoins that are attempting to grow a community and create scarcity have seen huge increases in the worth of their tokens. An example of this is the Binance token BNB, which has soared to all-time high prices (eclipsing even its 2017 bull run high) to trade up to its current $4.5 billion valuation. Bitcoin vs global aggregate negative yielding sovereign debt. Real straightforward situation. pic.twitter.com/Obmhnkbrf7 — Travis Kling (@Travis_Kling) June 27, 2019  Just days before a showdown between China and the USA at this weekend’s G20 summit, Bitcoin is rallying in tandem with the negative-yielding sovereign debt. Although sometimes hard to imagine (yes, someone does actually pay you to borrow money), this type of value proposition comes down to the fact that the debt is pegged to a local fiat currency that is ‘forecast’ to devalue faster than a so-called stable currency (like the US dollar) over the maturity period of the ‘sovereign note’. Bitcoin is now under a year away from its next key technical event, which will be the first time the asset is truly watched (and checked) by all as its supply is cut in half from 12.5 to 6.25 Bitcoins every block. The concept of digital scarcity can sometimes be hard to truly fathom. However, once understood, it could lead to the establishment of a new monetary union based on the principles of transparency and immutability in fair and free-market commerce. Of all the globally-traded and liquid digital assets available today, only Bitcoin looks to have the credentials and track record to fulfill this infant concept.

," Bitcoin Cash ABC rose by 1.9% on Wednesday. Reversing a 0.63% fall from Tuesday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $483.93. Bullish through much of the day, Bitcoin Cash ABC rallied from a morning low $462 to a late intraday high $516. Bitcoin Cash ABC tested the first major support level at $462.54 before breaking through the first major resistance level at $484.46 and second major resistance level at $484.46. The third major resistance level at $516.61 capped the upside before a late sell-off that saw Bitcoin Cash ABC slide to an intraday low $450.0. Bitcoin Cash ABC fell back through the first major support level to test the second major support level at $450.85 before recovering. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was down by 2.52% to $471.75. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise to a morning high $486.35 before falling to a low $467.37. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move back through to $483 levels would signal a recovery of the morning losses. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $486.35. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, Bitcoin Cash ABC would likely come up short of the first major resistance level at $516.62. Failure to move back through to $483 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC fall deeper into the red. A fall through to $463 levels would bring the first major support level at $450.62 into play. Litecoin slid by 3.6% on Wednesday. Reversing a 0.13% rise from Tuesday, Litecoin ended the day at $130.64. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin fall to a mid-morning low $133.1 before striking a mid-day intraday high $138.21. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $139.59, Litecoin slid to a late intraday low $122.46. The reversal saw Litecoin fall through the first major support level at $130.26 and second major support level at $124.96. Finding support from the broader market, Litecoin managed to recover to $130 levels late on. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 1.89% to $128.17. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin rise to a morning high $132.11 before sliding to a low $127.45. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested in the early hours. For the day ahead, a move back through to $130 levels would be needed for Litecoin to take a run at the first major resistance level at $138.41 Barring a crypto rebound, Litecoin will likely continue to come up short of $140 levels. Wednesday’s high and the first major resistance level should cap any upside in the event of a rebound. Failure to move back through to $130 levels could see Litecoin struggle on the day. A fall back through the morning low to $125 levels would bring the first major support level at $122.66 into play. Ripple’s XRP fell by 1.27% on Wednesday. Following on from a 1.81% decline on Tuesday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.45935. A bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rally from an early intraday low $0.45872 to a late afternoon intraday high $0.49342. The rally saw Ripple’s XRP broke through the first major resistance level at $0.4783 and second major resistance level at $0.4908. A late broad-based crypto sell-off did the damage, however, with Ripple’s XRP sliding to an intraday low $0.44374. The reversal saw Ripple’s XRP fall through the first major support level at $0.4526 before recovering to $0.45 levels. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 2.04% to $0.4500. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from a morning high $0.46433 to a low $0.44959. In spite of the early pullback, Ripple’s XRP steered clear of the first major support level at $0.4376. For the day ahead, a move back through to $0.4650 levels would support a run at $0.48 levels. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $0.4873. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, Ripple’s XRP would likely come up short of Wednesday’s high $0.49342. Failure to move back through to $0.4873 could see Ripple’s XRP take another hit later in the day. A pullback through to $0.44500 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.4376 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of sub-$0.43 support levels on the day.

SEC lawsuit against Canadian chat app has major implications for crypto industry," The value of bitcoin is up 102% in 2019. But the most important story playing out in the cryptocurrency world right now is an enforcement action by the SEC against Canadian chat app Kik Interactive. If you follow cryptocurrency at all—either as a speculative investor or as a believer in the technology—you should pay close attention to what happens next. On Monday, the SEC sued Kik for its “unregistered” ICO (initial coin offering) back in 2017, which the agency says was an illegal securities offering. In the token sale, Kik created and sold 1 trillion Kin tokens and raised $100 million; the SEC says $55 million of that came from U.S.-based investors. It was one of the five biggest ICOs of 2017. Kik, which has about 200 employees, knew the SEC action might be coming: In November 2018, the SEC issued Kik a Wells Notice, which informs companies that the agency is considering enforcement action. In a Medium blog post in January, Kik CEO Ted Livingston responded to the notice, promising that “We’re fighting back.” In that blog post, Livingston correctly wrote, “This is the thing that everyone in the industry is dealing with, but nobody wants to talk about... This situation is not unique to Kik. There are dozens of projects at a similar point with the SEC.” As Yahoo Finance reported last year in a joint investigation with Decrypt, the SEC had been reaching out to dozens of companies that conducted ICOs to request documentation or threaten enforcement—and in many cases quietly got settlements. But in November 2018 the SEC’s crusade against unregistered token sales got a lot less quiet when it publicly announced a handful of settlements. That month it also slapped boxer Floyd Mayweather with more than $600,000 in fines and rapper DJ Khaled with $152,000 in fines for promoting ICOs on their social media accounts. This new lawsuit against Kik is the most noteworthy enforcement action to date, and the result will be important for the entire industry. It might set the new standard of how companies conduct an ICO, if any still dare to try it. (Blockstack is already looking to pull off the first big ICO conducted with full SEC registration and approval.) The core issue the SEC has with ICOs is simple: it believes almost every token sale is a security offering. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton made that stance clear at a Senate hearing in February 2018 when he said, “I believe every ICO I’ve seen is a security.”   Capital raising through blockchain requires compliance with federal securities laws https://t.co/IjOxjoVdfK The SEC bases its view on SEC v. Howey, a 1946 case involving the selling of shares in a citrus grove. The SEC applies the Howey Test to determine whether an offering is raising money from investors in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit from the efforts of others. In its official Wells Response in November 2018, Kik retorted that buyers of Kin coins “were not led to expect profits from the efforts of others.” Kik CEO Livingston also makes the case that Kin is truly used as a currency and not a security, since Kik users can earn and spend Kin inside the Kik app and in other apps as well. Now it’s worth revisiting what Livingston said in interviews back in 2017 about the Kin ICO. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, he said, “Kin is a new way for us to monetize and compete... If supply [of Kin] stays constant and demand for it grows, the value of the cryptocurrency will grow. So that if we set some of it aside for ourselves, we can make a lot of money... If we can create Kin, integrate it into Kik, that will make it really valuable.” Does that sound like a company promising returns from a securities offering? The SEC believes it does. In the 49-page complaint, the SEC writes: “Kik marketed the Kin tokens as an investment opportunity. Kik allegedly told investors that rising demand would drive up the value of Kin.” The SEC also accuses Kik of resorting to an ICO as a “hail Mary pass” because the company was “faced with a shrinking financial runway” and “decided to pivot.” And indeed, in the same 2017 interview with Yahoo Finance, Livingston made the point that Kik and other tech startups needed to innovate and try new things in order to avoid getting “copied and crushed” by giants like Facebook. But the SEC’s lawsuit against Kik is no guaranteed win. Kik, which says it has 15 million monthly users, clearly does not intend to settle, even though it has already spent $5 million in legal fees dealing with the SEC.

34," Bitcoin is up an eye-popping 245% in 2019 so far. And based on many business news headlines of the past week, you’d think bitcoin’s surge is all thanks to Facebook (FB). But bitcoin was already up nearly 200% before June 18, when Facebook announced its plans to launch a cryptocurrency called Libra next year and a digital wallet called Calibra. And the Facebook news initially sent bitcoin lower for the first few days, before it recovered. The initial thinking in some circles after Facebook’s announcement was that Libra, which has big-name backers like Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, Spotify, Uber, and Lyft on board as “founding members,” will be bad for bitcoin, especially since the Libra Association says it aims for Libra to “put the term ‘currency’ back in cryptocurrency” by being a coin for everyday use. Libra Association’s head of policy Dante Disparte even took a clear shot at bitcoin, telling Yahoo Finance that Libra coin, “is designed to be a unit of purchase and a unit of daily transactions, as opposed to a speculative asset—which is, candidly, where many cryptocurrencies have stood.” One of the biggest mainstream criticisms of bitcoin has been that it’s merely become a speculative investment, not for regular use as an actual currency. But as the dust has settled from Facebook’s and Libra’s simultaneous June 18 announcements, more people in the cryptocurrency space are reasoning that the embrace of blockchain technology by Facebook and its other mainstream partners is an inherent endorsement of bitcoin. It is the “rising tide lifts all boats” argument. (Of course, the bitcoin community was quick to question whether Libra is truly decentralized, since Facebook executives are behind it, and whether Libra’s planned blockchain is a true “permissionless” ledger.) In other words: Facebook’s crypto push is likely at least partially helping push other cryptocurrencies higher. But it’s far from the main driver. So what’s the real reason bitcoin is moving higher in 2019? CME Group, which launched bitcoin futures trading back in December 2017, tweeted on June 18 about the “growing signs of institutional interest.” CME says it saw a new all-time high of bitcoin futures contracts on June 17.   CME Bitcoin futures (BTC) shows growing signs of institutional interest. BTC open interest rose by a record 643 contracts in a single day, establishing a new all-time high of 5,311 contracts on June 17 (26,555 equivalent bitcoin; ~$250M notional). https://t.co/I6A3jD6Iq3 pic.twitter.com/ljz6EbvK79 Grayscale Investments has also seen big gains for its publicly traded bitcoin fund Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), up 330% this year. In May, the firm launched a “Drop Gold” television ad campaign to push bitcoin as an investment class. There is a lot of positive institutional crypto news in the water recently. JPMorgan launched its own internal cryptocurrency, JPM Coin. The CFTC this week approved LedgerX to offer bitcoin derivatives contracts, and to settle them in actual bitcoin. And a report this month from Bitwise, highlighted by JPMorgan analysts, determined that institutional interest in the bitcoin futures market “has been significantly understated.” This has prompted the thinking that unlike the price hike at the end of 2017, which was driven by retail buying, “This time is different.” That’s how Genesis Trading CEO Michael Moro frames it too. “This is a very different market today than it was in 2017,” he says. “2019 has less distractions. It's also a different space because the CME bitcoin futures product wasn’t available until December 2017.” Genesis says its trading volumes are two to three times higher than they were 12 months ago. Lightning Labs, which offers a scaling alternative to the bitcoin blockchain and has been gaining momentum recently thanks to support from Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, released its first mobile app on Wednesday and saw an immediate flood of downloads. And then there are the geopolitical factors. Many believe that President Trump’s endless trade war and tariff tit-for-tat with China (and threats of tariffs on other countries) has buoyed bitcoin, which is seen as a safe haven asset like gold. And earlier this month, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi suggested the need for more ECB monetary stimulus, prompting criticism from Trump—that also was seen as a boon to bitcoin. All of these factors have likely had a far bigger impact on the bitcoin price over the past few months than Facebook. — Daniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

Is Libra crypto’s best gateway drug to date?," It turned out to be true. The rumours and speculation that arose when Facebook began advertising job openings for blockchain engineers were right. Facebook’s first foray into cryptocurrency is coming – first dubbed ‘Facebook Coin’, then ‘Global Coin’, and now officially announced as Libra with the release of the white paper. The way the white paper reads reminds me a lot of Stellar Lumens and what it is aiming to accomplish. Facebook could have just built on top of Stellar, but it likely saw too little profit and too little control with that approach. The approach Facebook is taking is to invite 100 organisations to become members of the Libra Association. The social media giant is also charging $10 million for the privilege of running a node on the network to validate transactions. Like Stellar, the Libra Association is a non-profit organisation, the purpose of which is to coordinate activity relating to the growth of the Libra ecosystem. The founding members are listed in the white paper and feature many household names such as PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay, and Uber. It’s at this point we have another instance of something I mentioned in a previous article. In that post, I mentioned how the masses are not interested in investing a lot of time researching and thinking about new technologies in order to derive trust from understanding. They much prefer to wait for a signal from an organisation they see as an authority and just assume that organisation has done the research and thinking for them. This is principally why I ask whether Libra will become the best gateway drug for the existing cryptocurrency industry. More than two billion users log in to Facebook each day. With a bank of attention like that, Facebook can jump to the front of the line of advertisers and provide instant exposure to any new feature or product. The minimal amount of effort born out of it being integrated with Facebook avoids the apathy that has no doubt hindered Bitcoin adoption among Facebook users. If you think back to another one of my articles about the new Voice social network, you may notice that they share a similar obstacle – the requirement to verify your identity. The conflict I see there with Libra is that it is designed for financial inclusion but will struggle to verify the identity of people in countries that don’t have a working government ID system that is digital. There is however a part of the white paper that states: “The Libra Blockchain is pseudonymous and allows users to hold one or more addresses that are not linked to their real-world identity.” So we will have to see how that manifests in the final product. The big question is this: how close to the original white paper will Libra end up being? The US Congress is already calling for Facebook to slow down if not stop development of Libra until they have had a chance to get their head around it and determine what kind of risks it poses to consumers. It is likely that the original vision for Libra will become diluted by regulation before it is launched. Keep your eye on the headlines for news on how this develops. A gateway drug is what we call something that is a mild introduction to something that gets the user hooked before they trade up to something stronger. This may be what happens when Libra is launched. Facebook will do all the work of introducing the concept of a cryptocurrency to its huge user base, get them used to it, and then it’s a much smaller leap for those users to adopt Bitcoin. Here is an illustration of the process of buying Libra, provided by Facebook: All it would take is for one of the cryptocurrency exchanges to create a market that allows Libra to trade against Bitcoin and the average Facebook user has a way of buying Libra with their national currency and exchanging it for Bitcoin. Even if regulation doesn’t allow cryptocurrency exchanges to list Libra, it will undoubtedly end up on decentralised or peer-to-peer markets such as OpenBazaar, with individuals trading it directly between themselves.

Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed bag for the rest of the pack. Joining Bitcoin in the green on the day were Ethereum and Litecoin, with gains of 1.8% and 0.13% respectively. It was red for the rest of the top 10. Leading the way down were Binance Coin and Stellar’s Lumen. The pair fell by 4.4% and 3.5% respectively. EOS and Ripple’s XRP fell by 1.87% and 1.81%, while Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash SV fell by just 0.63% and 0.17% respectively. The moves through Tuesday saw Bitcoin’s dominance break through to 60% levels for the first time since April 2017. Bitcoin also drove the total crypto market cap to $336.68bn on the day, up from $330.43bn on Monday. In spite of the Bitcoin rally, 24-hour trading volumes held relatively steady, rising from $70.15bn to $71.9bn levels on the day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 6.1% to $12,453.0. A particularly bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rally from a morning low $11,684.5 to a high $12,945.0. The early morning rally saw Bitcoin break through the first major resistance level at $12,077.33 and second resistance level at $12,417.67. From the rest of the top 10, Litecoin and EOS struggled through the morning. At the time of writing, the pair were down by 1% and by 0.12% respectively. It was bullish for the rest of the pack. Coming in a distant second behind Bitcoin was Ethereum, which was up by 3.74%. Stellar’s Lumen also found support, rising by 2.2%, with Binance Coin up by 1.22%. The broad-based crypto rally added $25bn to the total market cap, with the market cap sitting at $361.25bn. Trading volumes were also up from $72bn levels to $94bn levels. Bitcoin would need to hold above the second major resistance level at $12,417.67 to support another run at $13,000 levels. While we can expect Bitcoin to face plenty of resistance at $13,000 levels, Bitcoin could take a run at the third major resistance level at $13,395.67. Bitcoin would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high $12,945.0. Failure to hold above the second major resistance level at $12,417.67 could see Bitcoin give up some of the morning gains. A pullback through to $12,300 levels could see Bitcoin fall back through the first major resistance level at $12,077.33. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should avoid a return to sub-$12,000 levels on the day.

"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 21/06/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC fell by 0.94% on Thursday. Reversing a 0.21% rise from Wednesday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $412.61. A choppy start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC slide from an early intraday high $418.88 to a late morning intraday low $405.85. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $420.34, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the first major support level at $410.14. Finding support late on, Bitcoin Cash ABC recovered to $412 levels to cut the losses on the day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 3.27% to $426.12. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $415.28 to a high $427.34. Bitcoin Cash ABC broke through the first major resistance level at $419.04 and second major resistance level at $425.48 early on. For the day ahead, a hold above the second major resistance level at $425.48 would support a break out to $430 levels. In the event of an extended rally through the day Bitcoin Cash ABC could come against the third major resistance level at $438.51. We would expect Bitcoin Cash ABC to come up short of the current week high $440, however. Failure to hold above the second major resistance level at $425.48 could see Bitcoin Cash ABC slide back to sub-$420 levels. Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin Cash ABC would likely avoid a pullback through the first major resistance level at $419.04. In the event of a meltdown, a fall through $412 levels would bring the first major support level at $406.01 into play before any recovery. Litecoin fell by 0.5% on Thursday. Partially reversing a 1.27% gain from Wednesday, Litecoin ended the day at $135.99. Bearish through most of the day, Litecoin fell from a start of a day intraday high $137.15 to a late afternoon intraday low $133.37. Coming up short of the first major resistance level at $139.79, Litecoin tested the first major support level at $133.70. Finding support late in the day, Litecoin recovered to $135 levels to limit the loss on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 1.58% to $137.89. Tracking the broader market, Litecoin rose from a morning low $135.83 to a high $138.12 before easing back. Litecoin broke through the first major resistance level at $137.64 early on. For the day ahead, a hold onto $137 levels through the morning would support further upside on the day. A move back through the morning high $138.12 would support a run at the second major resistance level at $139.28. In the event of a breakout, Litecoin could take a run at $140 levels before any pullback. We would expect Litecoin to come up short of the third major resistance level at $143.06 on the day. Failure to hold onto $137 levels could see Litecoin slide back through to $135 levels. A fall through $135.5 would bring the first major support level at $133.86 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Litecoin will likely steer clear of the second major support level at $131.72. Ripple’s XRP slipped by 0.8% on Thursday. Partially reversing a 2.09% rise from Wednesday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.43280. A bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rise to an early morning intraday high $0.43784 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $0.4425, Ripple’s XRP slid to a late intraday low $0.42117. The reversal saw Ripple’s XRP fall through the first major support level at $0.42760 before a late move back through to $0.43 levels. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 2.56% to $0.44250. A particularly bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rally from a morning low $0.43133 to a high $0.44609. Ripple’s XRP broke through the first major resistance level at $0.4400 to come within range of the second major resistance level at $0.4473. For the day ahead, a hold above $0.4380 levels through the morning would support a run at the second major resistance level at $0.4473. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $0.44609. In the event of an extended crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP could strike $0.45 levels before any pullback. Failure to hold above $0.4380 levels could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse. A fall through to sub-$0.4310 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.4234 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ripple’s XRP would likely steer clear of sub-$0.42 levels on the day.

," Voice. Everyone should have one. That is the premise behind a new blockchain-based social network recently announced by Block.one – the company that created the source code for EOS and continues to develop it. In a bold statement at the company’s June 1 event at the DC Armory in Washington, DC, the CEO of Block.one – Brendan Bloomer – said that the major social networks of today are designed to use their users. They use our data and our attention to make money primarily through advertising. Voice, a new social network, is designed to correct this by bringing power and control back to the individual user, using blockchain technology of course. The problem many – if not all – crypto projects have is that they do not exist in isolation. There are many other components that their success relies on that they don’t have the resources to build themselves. Therefore, whenever something new is introduced, there is a lot of “yeah, but”, because the scope of any given project has to stop somewhere. The Voice social network may be the thing that everyone is focusing on, but there were a number of other elements to the announcement that dealt with many of the prerequisites to making such a project successful. In order to use a blockchain-based app like Voice, users need to create an account on the underlying blockchain platform. This costs money and is complex, so Block.one decided to offer free EOS accounts to remove the friction of getting started using Voice. In order to perform transactions on an EOS app like Voice, each user needs to hold tokens and be allocated network resources. In a two-in-one announcement at the recent event, Coinbase spoke about the ability to earn free EOS tokens by going through a set of short educational video lessons the company has created at https://www.coinbase.com/earn/eos. This not only helps new users get to grips with the EOS network, they also get rewarded with free tokens and thus an allocation of network resources that enable them to do transactions. Crypto tokens and accounts use public and private keys. These are complex to manage, store, and secure. The average social network user will find this far too much to grasp. On to the stage at the June 1 event came a representative from Yubico, a company that makes and develops the Yubikey – a device that acts much like a physical key except for the digital world. If you possess the metal key to your house, you simply turn it in the lock and get access. It’s so simple that anyone and everyone can do it, including children. Now let’s say we mirror that in the digital world. Instead of usernames and passwords (which we don’t need to unlock the front door to our house), we have a Yubikey on our key ring right next to all our metal keys. When we want to log in to an online service like the Voice social network, we simply insert our digital key into the lock (USB port) and go straight in. This is so close to the experience and ease of unlocking locks in the physical world as to have almost no learning curve. For a number of years, Dan Larimer, the CTO of Block.one, has said that decentralised alternatives will not succeed if they are only as good as their centralised equivalents – they need to be superior. Passwordless access to your social media account qualifies as a superior user experience in my book. Blockchain-based social networks are far too slow for the average user to bother with. Another announcement that was made at the June event was EOSIO 2, a much-upgraded version of the software that underpins EOS-based blockchains. The most significant update the team focused on was performance. EOSIO 2 can apparently run code 12 times faster than the original code Block.one released. Performance is obviously a crucial feature given the speed at which people interact on social networks. If the network is slow, users will not put up with it for long. I am a big fan of the existing blockchain social network Steem. Also created by Dan Larimer, this network distributes newly-created cryptocurrency based on the popularity of content that is posted rather than the pure hardware-based mining that Bitcoin uses. Young people especially have no loyalty to their social networks. They will switch to whatever is hot and trending. I am confident that if Voice proves to be superior even to Steem, then the offer of a new social network that pays you (with the Voice token) to post will be an offer that the youth can’t refuse. Especially when they find out they can spend their tokens to amplify the visibility of their posts and gather more attention. Once young people have validated the platform, they will begin to drag everyone else with them. The difference this time is that they may well stick because as they post, they earn tokens, which act like a share in the platform itself. It’s the sense of ownership that I think is missing from the centralised social networks that causes the disloyalty. That and a distrust of the big, centralised networks. Since trust is not even a consideration for an open public blockchain that runs on open source software, we have a bag of incentives that may well have an appeal far beyond the younger generation. But there is an even bigger source of certainty with Voice – identity. Facebook has a problem with fake accounts. There is an incentive for underground marketing agencies to create millions of fake accounts and use them to begin contacting and promoting all manner of products and services. In fact, Facebook recently revealed that it had closed 2.2 billion fake accounts. The plan with Voice is to use a special authentication system to ensure no individual human creates more than one account. This includes only storing the digital fingerprint of the person on the blockchain instead of all their personal identity data. This ensures compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR. Once you have a social media account you can log in to with a private key that is tied to a unique human individual, opportunities to do some unimaginable stuff open up. A couple of big ones I am thinking of are incorruptible political voting and even universal basic income.

With the release of the new mobile application, users can now send Bitcoin instantly around the world using their mobile phone, with full control over their own funds and data. We've released the mainnet alpha of our Lightning Mobile App for iOS & Android, the first on all major platforms! ⚡️📲 Send money instantly around the world. Control your own funds and data with Neutrino and Autopilot. Read more and try it out here: https://t.co/d9V6P2dkzf pic.twitter.com/OnGNI8qik6 — Lightning Labs⚡️ (@lightning) June 19, 2019  Following the recent release of the firm’s Lightning app on desktop, the alpha release on mobile means the app is now available across the full platform suite of iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux. In the announcement blog post, the team said that they had “designed the mobile app to be approachable for a wide range of users”, with “a clean user interface and a goal to hide complexity” for new users. The team also confirmed that as with the desktop app, “the mobile app integrates a fully functional Lightning Network node using our very own LND”. The new mobile app also includes the same two core technologies that power the desktop app. The first, Neutrino, is a “light client specification that allows non-custodial Lightning wallets to verify Bitcoin transactions”, giving improved privacy without needing to sync the full Bitcoin blockchain (which is about 225 GB). The second feature is Autopilot, which helps users select which node to open a channel with (as the team think this is something many users will not be equipped to do). Commenting on the launch, the CEO of Lightning Labs, Elizabeth Stark – seemingly in a nod to the great infrastructure vs service provider debate – said: “When it comes to AOL vs the internet, I’m betting on the internet every time.” It’s still early days, but with the technology-focused company now completing the release of its full suite of interoperable tools for Bitcoin’s most prominent layer-two scaling solution, the project is taking another small step closer to its goal of delivering instant digital micropayments for all.

Singapore government proposes to exempt value-added tax on cryptocurrencies," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of “digital payment tokens” in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, “will not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.” The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: “(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.”  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. “A digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,” it said.",Yogita Khatri,The Block,2019-07-08T07:12:34.000Z
Bitcoin Technical Analysis – Support Levels in Play," Bucking the trend from across the broader market, Bitcoin fell by 3.38% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 10.18% rally from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,920. A particularly bearish start to the day on Saturday saw Bitcoin slide from an intraday high $12,338 to an early morning intraday low $11,354. In spite of the early sell-off, Bitcoin steered clear of the first major support level at $11,285.67 and the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Finding support from the broader market, Bitcoin managed to recover to $12,200 levels before sliding back to sub-$12,000 levels. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 9.3%, which came off the back of 4 days in the green out of the last 6. In what was a choppy week for the broader crypto market, Bitcoin was one of just 3 of the top 10 cryptos to be in positive territory for the current week. As a result of the current week gains, Bitcoin’s dominance continued to hold at 62%. Bitcoin’s bullish week saw the Bitcoin’s market cap rise from $190bn to a Thursday high $245.13bn before easing back. At the time of writing, the market cap stood at $210.82bn. 24-hour trading volumes were also on the up, rising from $20bn levels to hit $46bn levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, 24-hour trading volumes stood at $39.4bn. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December’s swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin continued to hold above the 23.6% FIB of $11,275, with a 39.7% rally for the current month leading to a 211% gain year-to-date. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.59% to $11,850. A choppy morning saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $12,234 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,390.33, Bitcoin fell to a mid-morning intraday low $11,681. In spite of the pullback, Bitcoin steered clear of the first major support level at $11,397.33 and the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. A move back through to $12,000 levels would support another run at the first major resistance level at $12,390.33. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from this morning’s high $12,234.0. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, Bitcoin would likely come up short of $12,300 levels on the day. In the event of a 2nd half of a day bounce, a breakthrough the first major resistance level would bring $12,500 levels into play before any pullback. Failure to move back through to $12,000 levels could see Bitcoin fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $11,681 would bring the first major support level at $11,397.33 into play.

1," Bitcoin saw red for a 3rd consecutive day to kick off the 3rd quarter on the back foot. Bitcoin fell by 1.48% on Monday. Following on from a 9.33% slide on Sunday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,640. A relatively bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $10,641 to an early morning intraday high $11,231. While falling well short of the first major resistance level at $11,806, Bitcoin came up against the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 before hitting reverse. An afternoon sell-off saw Bitcoin slide to an early evening intraday low $10,088 before finding support. The reversal saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level before recovering to $10,600 levels. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of green across the crypto-board. Leading the way on the day was EOS, which rallied by 4.96%. Close behind was Bitcoin Cash ABC, which rose by 4.11%. Binance Coin and Ripple’s XRP also saw solid gains, rising by 3.86% and by 3.49% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.00%), Ethereum (+1.25%), and Stellar’s Lumen (+2.04%) saw more modest gains on the day. With Bitcoin bucking the trend to see red on the day, Bitcoin’s dominance fell back to 60% levels. A choppy day for the crypto majors led the total crypto market cap to sub-$300bn levels before a late recovery. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $303.56bn. Following a bullish month for Bitcoin, the pullback from $12,000 levels to test support at $10,000 will test investor resilience. It wouldn’t be the first time that Bitcoin slid back from a momentum driven rally… At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 3.44% to $10,274.4. An early morning high $10,719 came up short of the first major resistance level at $11,796 before hitting reverse. Bitcoin fell to a morning low $10,263 before steadying. In spite of the pullback, Bitcoin held above the first major support level at $10,075. It was a sea of red across the crypto majors. Litecoin and Binance Coin were alongside Bitcoin at the time of writing. The pair were down by 3.26% and $3.14% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV saw a modest loss of just 0.48% through the early hours. Bitcoin would need to move back through to $10,700 levels to support a broad-based crypto market rebound. A move through to $10,700 levels would bring $11,000 levels into play before any pullback. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level at $11,218 and 23.6% FIB of $11,275 would likely limit any upside. In the event of a rebound, Bitcoin could test the second major resistance level at $11,796 before any pullback. Failure to move back through to $10,700 levels could see Bitcoin struggle through the day. A slide through the morning low $10,263 would bring the first major support level at $10,075 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,000 support levels on the day. In the event of a meltdown, the 38.2% FIB of $9,734 and second major support level at $9,510 should limit the damage.

," Bitcoin has made a 130% gain so far this year. The stock markets are down amidst the US-China trade war, which usually spurs investors toward safe-haven assets. But people aren’t buying gold. Institutions are leaping on the blockchain bandwagon one after another, with Bitcoin trading at a massive 37% premium on Grayscale. Facebook is also entering the space, as are JP Morgan and Fidelity… the list of household names with Bitcoin FOMO is getting longer. So why aren’t the crowds going wild? Around the time of the industry’s most important conference of the year – Consensus – earlier this month, Bitcoin shot up by over $1,000 overnight. eBay announced (and later retracted) that it would be accepting cryptocurrency payments. Microsoft came out with its plans to build on the Bitcoin blockchain. North American food chain Whole Foods also joined the revolution and the price started to soar. Yet despite what historically causes a massive “gold rush” of retail investors suffering from Bitcoin FOMO, this rally is far from retail-driven. In fact, it appears to be the institutions that are scared of missing out. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust accumulated 11,236 bitcoin in April alone. Currently 54,000 bitcoin are mined per month. Right now, they are buying up 21% of the new supply of bitcoin. In a year, the halvening will double that number to 42% of the supply. Institutions are FOMOing. — Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) May 29, 2019  With the Bitcoin halvening happening next year, Bitcoin is becoming more scarce and more valuable. More of it will be owned by institutions. That might sound like a stupid question. After all, the price would just go up, right? Well, yes. However, there are some other indicators that can alert us to a possible retail buying spree. What do most people do when they want to find out more about something? They turn to Google for their answer. Of course, Google may not be the only search engine around the world, with Yandex, Baidu, and a plethora of privacy browsers. But when it comes to market leadership, Google still takes the cake with 88.47% of the market share in April 2019. So, with all the action going on in the markets right now, you would imagine that searches for Bitcoin would be going through the roof. Not so much. In fact, take a look at the information below from Google Trends and you’ll see that interest in Bitcoin is hovering around the same level as it was in May 2017, way before Bitcoin FOMO started in earnest. Out of the countries where Bitcoin searches take the lead, the top three are in Africa. That could be attributed to increasing awareness due to African blockchain conferences, and increasing use cases as well. Where legislation strangles businesses trading internationally, it’s much easier to send and receive payments in Bitcoin. Nigerians have seen a massive devaluation of their local currency in recent years. This could also be behind Bitcoin purchases by people trying to shield their savings. Austria and the Netherlands have recently had major Bitcoin conferences and an outpouring of institutional support that could be driving curiosity. But still… Bitcoin FOMO is not at a significant height anywhere around the world at the moment. Another indicator to use is to look at data form LocalBitcoins for each country. Again, this hardly confirms Bitcoin FOMO. Globally, this week has seen a modest rise in Bitcoin purchases, but it’s still a far and distant cry from the 2017 Bitcoin mania. Even in Nigeria, which registers the most Bitcoin searches, purchasing volume on LocalBitcoins has dropped this week. It could be tighter regulation in countries like China and the US. Or maybe greater education and fear of losing funds from hackers. Perhaps many investors were simply burned last time – buying at an all-time high – and are still waiting to recoup their losses. In terms of returns in 2019, Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset and run circles around oil, gold, commodities, and even the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. With more institutional adoption, increasing trade tensions, and the Bitcoin halvening coming up, the bullish trend looks set to continue. There are some analysts like Tone Vays that are calling for a pullback. However, it appears that the majority of traders and industry experts expect Bitcoin to continue climbing. Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner of Kenetic, recently spoke to Bloomberg and is calling for an all-time high of $30,000 by the end of this year. He is also extremely bullish on Ethereum and Ripple. So, the question definitely isn’t whether Bitcoin FOMO will set in, but when and where it will happen first.

1," Bitcoin rallied by 10.09% on Wednesday. Following on from a 2.29% gain on Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,983. A bullish start to the day set the tone, with Bitcoin on the move from the start of the day. Bitcoin rallied from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. The moves through the early hours saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and the first major resistance level at $11,762.87. A pullback to sub-$11,000 levels by late morning saw Bitcoin steer clear of the first major support level at $10,087.13 before a late rally. The late rally saw Bitcoin break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275, first major resistance level at $11,323.93, and second major resistance level at $11,762.87 to hit an intraday high $12,025. Resistance at $12,000 limited the upside on the day. The Bitcoin rally led to Bitcoin’s dominance rising back to 62% levels. Bitcoin’s market cap jumped to a Wednesday high $213.5bn before easing back. Bitcoin ultimately provided support to the broader crypto market, leading the majors into positive territory on the day. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December’s swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin continued to find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Wednesday’s rally was another day of correlation with the more mature markets. The rally kicked in well ahead of economic data out of the U.S, however. Weak U.S stats continued to support the FED’s projected rate cut later in the day year. While the cheaper cost of funds is a boon for riskier assets, the current interest rate environment continues to be supportive. A negative for Bitcoin and the broader market continues to be the prospect of a material shift in the regulatory landscape. There’s also the pending SEC decisions on the Bitcoin ETFs to consider. The recent volatility across the broader market has come at the wrong time for those hoping for Bitcoin ETFs to be approved. The good news, however, is the fact that there have been no headline cases of exchanges being hacked… Another piece of good news is the fact that the planned launch of Facebook’s Libra has done no damage just yet… At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.63% to $11,787. In the early part of the day, Bitcoin rose to a start of a day high $12,065 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,379.33, Bitcoin fell back to a late morning low $11,503. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33, Bitcoin moved back through to $11,700 levels. For the Bitcoin bulls, $12,000 looks to be the line in the sand. A hold onto $11,700 levels through the early afternoon would support a move back through to $11,900 levels. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $12,065. In the event of a breakout, the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 would come into play before any pullback. Failure to hold onto $11,700 levels could see Bitcoin slide back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Barring an extended sell-off through the afternoon, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit the downside. In the event of a sell-off, expect a return to sub-$11,000 levels before finding support.

"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 05/07/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC slid by 5% on Thursday. Reversing a 2.25% gain from Wednesday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $398.17. Relatively range-bound through most of the day, Bitcoin Cash ABC rose to a mid-morning intraday high $420.79 before falling to a late morning low $410.9. Whilst steering clear of the major support and resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell back through the 23.6% FIB of $418. A brief visit to $419 levels was short-lived, with Bitcoin Cash ABC sliding to an intraday low $398.17 in the final hour of the day. The sell-off saw Bitcoin Cash ABC slide through the 23.6% FIB and first major support level at $407.36. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 0.9% to $401.77. A relatively bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $396.33 to a high $402.01. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, Bitcoin Cash ABC would need to move through to $406 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $413.25. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need support from the broader market, however, to break through to $410 levels. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin Cash ABC could take a run at $420 levels. Failure to move through to $406 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC hit reverse. A fall through the morning low $396.33 would bring the first major support level at $390.63 into play. Barring another crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$390 support levels on the day. Litecoin fell by 1.8% on Thursday. Partially reversing 2.69% rise from Wednesday, Litecoin ended the day at $119.59. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin rally from a morning low $119.03 to a late morning intraday high $127.37. Steering clear of the major support levels, Litecoin broke through the first major resistance level at $124.22 and second major resistance level at $126.66. After pulling back to $121 levels Litecoin managed a return to $126 levels before succumbing to market forces. A final hour sell-off saw Litecoin slide to an intraday low $118.59. In spite of the sell-off, Litecoin left the first major support level at $118.28 untested on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 0.05% to $119.53. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a low $118.5 to a high $120.14 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move through to $122 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $124.96. Litecoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at Thursday’s high $127.37. An early move through to $125 levels would bring the second major resistance level at $130.34 into play. Failure to move through to $122 levels could see Litecoin fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $118.5 would bring the 23.6% FIB of $117 into play before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Litecoin should steer clear of the first major support level at $116.62. Ripple’s XRP slid by 4.47% on Thursday. Reversing a 1.33% from Wednesday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.38787. Bearish from the start of the day, Ripple’s XRP fell from an early intraday high $0.40659 to a late intraday low $0.3857. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Ripple’s XRP fell through the first major support level at $0.3984 and second major support level at $0.3914. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 0.01% to $0.38783. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from a morning high $0.3892 to a low $0.3844 before steadying. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move through to $0.3935 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $0.4011. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, for a break out from $0.3950 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP will likely come up short of $0.40 levels on the day. Failure to move through to $0.3935 levels could see Ripple’s XRP fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $0.3844 would bring the first major support level at $0.3802 into play. An extended sell-off through the day could see Ripple’s XRP fall to sub-$0.38 levels before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of the second major support level at $0.3725.

2," At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $7,700 after price spiked during the weekend, climbing from $7,450 to almost $8,200. BTC is trading above its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs after a massive spike in price earlier in May which took Bitcoin through the roof on almost all exchanges. I’m hopeful the trend will continue for the time being, but there may well be another pullback on the horizon which could take BTC back to $5,800-$6,200. Of course, as more time passes, the less likely this becomes. Traders say the trend is your friend until the end. As of the middle of March, it seems we’ve been continually accumulating at higher prices, meaning we are definitely following a bullish trend. Let’s take a look at what’s going on with the Bitcoin markets. Bitcoin experienced a minor rally that took its price upwards close to 10% over the weekend. Afterwards, price pulled back closer to its support levels. At the moment, the market is moving upwards with higher lows each time it falls. Even though BTC is accumulating close to the $8,000 region, price wants to grow past $9,000. The more an asset tests a given level, the higher the chances are it will eventually break it. Just don’t forget it works both ways. This means if we see Bitcoin touching the $7,000 – $7,200 level again, it could mean it will retrace back to its 20-day EMA. I therefore advise traders to be very careful when entering new positions at the moment. Support levels above the crucial long-term zone are now found near $7,400 and $7,250, while below the $6,850 level, further strong support is found near $6,200, where the 50-day EMA is currently sitting. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that, I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now in charge. Volume-wise, we are reaching record highs again, even though current volumes are thin and a pullback has the greatest likelihood. I personally would like the price of Bitcoin to continue shooting to the moon, but retracements are expected! Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $10,000 by the end of 2019. Later this week, I’ll release an article discussing how crypto adoption is growing, which will clearly help push prices. If you don’t immediately understand why, let’s ask Mati Greenspan what he thinks: Facebook coin isn't a competitor to Bitcoin, it's a competitor to the Dollar. — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) June 9, 2019  Hopefully the market will continue this positive momentum.

Latest Bitcoin price and analysis (BTC to USD)," At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading close to $9,200 after price spiked during the weekend, climbing 18% from $7,800 to $9,250 in just a couple of hours. It seems the hypothesis that weekends are good for Bitcoin is indeed true. But will Bitcoin maintain its weekend gains during the next few days? Bitcoin experienced a major rally that took its price upwards close to 18% over the weekend. Afterwards, price pulled back closer to its new support level at around $8,800. At the moment, the market is moving upwards with higher lows each time it falls, meaning we should expect BTC to continue its climb towards $10,000 – which in my opinion might come within the next couple of weeks before the end of the month. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal – not only in shorter time-frames but also in daily and weekly ones as well – I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past seven days, volume went from $17 billion to $23 billion, retracing today to the $20 billion region. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $10,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Of course, if you think I might be overreacting to positive news, you can always check what other expert analysts have to say about this recent price movement. It's over 9000!!!! pic.twitter.com/cvJX8Blsgw — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) May 30, 2019  Hopefully, the market will continue this positive momentum.

," Bitcoin led the way on Thursday, but this time for all the wrong reasons… Bitcoin tumbled by 6.85% on Thursday. Partially reversing Wednesday’s 10.09% rally to end the day at $11,162.5. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning intraday high $12,065 to a late morning low $11,503. The moves through the morning saw Bitcoin leave the major support and resistance levels untested. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin recovered to an afternoon high $11,922 before taking a hit in the final hour. The final hour sell-off saw Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33. For Bitcoin, the only positive of the day was the avoidance of sub-$11,000 levels for the first time since 29th June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was red for all but one of the top 10 cryptos on Thursday. Bucking the trend on the day was Binance Coin, which rose by 1.23%. It was deep red for the rest of the pack. Ethereum was close behind Bitcoin, sliding by 6.29%, with EOS (-5.62%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-5%) also seeing heavy losses. Things were not much better for Ripple’s XRP and Tron, which fell by 4.47% and 4.7% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin saw more modest losses on the day. While Bitcoin Cash SV fell by 3.44%, Litecoin fell by just 1.8%. The Bitcoin sell-off on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance pulling back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.5% The total crypto market cap fell from a high $338.45bn to end the day at $319.29bn on Thursday, weighed by Bitcoin’s pullback. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.35% to $11,201. Moves in the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $11,005 to a high $11,287 before easing back. Whilst leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 before the pullback. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.71%), EOS (+0.23%) and Ethereum (+0.25%) also found early support. Litecoin and Binance Coin struggled at the start, with losses of 0.56% and 0.6% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to $11,430 levels to support a reversal of Thursday’s losses. A move through to $11,500 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,800 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $11,287. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could touch $12,000 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,430 levels could see Bitcoin take another hit. A fall through the morning low $11,005 would bring the first major support level at $10,790 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $10,417.5 on the day.

6," At the time of writing, the positive momentum in the cryptocurrency markets is still present. Bitcoin is well on the way to $10,000, and that means we can expect some altcoins to pump higher as well. Bitcoin has broken past the $6,000, $7,000, and $8,000 levels with ease. Since then, we touched the $9,000 level for a brief moment before returning to the $8,500 area soon after. However, over this past weekend, BTC was able to break the $9,000 level again and remain above it, finding support near $9,100. We can’t forget Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset that is helping investors dodge economic and geopolitical risks in the form of trade wars, sluggish GDP growth, and what appears to be a new era of quantitative easing for central banks. For that reason, the coin has emerged as the top-performing asset of 2019, vastly outperforming stocks, bonds, commodities, and government-backed currencies. Plus, Bitcoin’s all-time ROI is now over 6,000%. Let’s take a look at how the top cryptocurrencies have been performing. Bitcoin experienced a major rally that took its price upwards close to 18% over the weekend. Afterwards, price pulled back closer to its new support level at around $9,100. At the moment, the market is moving upwards with higher lows each time it falls, meaning we should expect BTC to continue its climb towards $10,000 – which in my opinion might come within the next couple of weeks before the end of the month. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal – not only in shorter time-frames but also in daily and weekly ones as well – I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past seven days, volume went from $17 billion to $23 billion, retracing today to the $20 billion region. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $10,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Looking at the Ethereum chart above, we can clearly see a couple of interesting features. Firstly, the 20-day EMA has crossed the 50-day EMA, and the latter has crossed the 200-day EMA, which are both quite bullish signals. Price is now also trading well above the 200-day EMA at over $270. Moreover, there could now be new support forming around $220, just above the 200-day EMA. The newly achieved yearly highs for Ethereum have been brought about thanks to the massive boost in Bitcoin recently. For the time being, I expect ETH to maintain its positive momentum, as I don’t see a reason for the trend to break. Volume-wise, ETH has been growing steadily. It went from about $7 billion last week to over $9 billion today – a sign of a healthy bull market. Ripple (XRP) has had a pretty bullish period as of late. Just look at the chart above. In mid-May 2019, price skyrocketed from about $0.294 to $0.47 – representing a 40% rise. It then crashed back to close to its 200-day EMA, around $0.37, before recovering back to above $0.42, where it sits now. Not only that, but the price of XRP managed to cross the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs as volumes went berserk. I expect support to be around $0.43 and then again at $0.38, where the 200-day EMA is sitting. If the 50-day EMA crosses or touches the 200-day EMA during June, we should expect XRP to go past $0.50. If volumes stay on the side of buyers, which seems to be likely, I’m expecting some altcoins like XRP to start picking up speed towards higher target levels. LTC has gained close to 7% since last week, which is quite an amazing achievement from a coin that was trading around $30 in January 2019 and peaked at $100 in April. Fundamentals remain strong as LTC’s adoption keeps rising due to small fees and faster block times. Plus, the halvening event is just around the corner, and this usually has a tendency to push prices upwards. At the moment, price is trading above $135, and I expect it to continue to rise towards the $150 and $170 levels, where it should find resistance. If you were one of the smart ones who bought-in during the early 2019 dip, congratulations! LTC has been the best performing coin in 2019, growing from about $30 to $135 in just a few months. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently sitting above $435 – almost 11% higher than last week – following my prediction that BCH would break the $400 level. Bitcoin is still gaining market-share dominance over most coins, including BCH, and BCH price is currently trading at its lowest against BTC since late 2018. However, this doesn’t mean investors won’t take this opportunity to convert BTC into BCH. Bitcoin Cash has broken the major $350 level around its 20-day EMA, and the 50-day EMA is getting close to the 200-day EMA. Moreover, the trend seems to be quite bullish, even though volumes have shrunk over the past week. If order books stay on the side of buyers, which will become increasingly difficult the more price goes up, we could see BCH climbing again to $500 and above in just a few days. Last week, I wrote my expectation was for Bitcoin to moon to $10,000 soon. It certainly seems like we’re going in that direction now. A smart move is to make small entries both when price corrects around target support levels and if price moves upwards towards resistance levels. Safe trades!

57," Bitcoin is more popular than the royal wedding, and the world’s biggest reality television star? Those are essentially the findings of a new study by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. According to the data, not only have more than half of Americans heard of bitcoin (BTC-USD), but more of them have searched for it this year on Google than Kim Kardashian this year. In fact, three times more. “We look at Google searches of Kim Khadashian, of election results, of the royal wedding, and Bitcoin topped all of those,” said Nina Willdorf, Coinbase’s director of content & editorial on “YFi PM.” “We found that awareness is quite high: 60% of Americans say they’ve heard of bitcoin,” she said. “When you compare that to other broad phenomenon, it’s great.” Bitcoin has been on a seesaw, rallying to 2019 highs near $13,000 but retracing some of those gains in the last few sessions. Still the cryptocurrency has more than tripled since the start of the year. That could be because there is a high correlation between Google searches for bitcoin and its price action, according to a note by research firm SEMrush. It’s not surprising that California, a wealthy coastal state, has the highest percentage of the population owning cryptocurrency. However, the Coinbase study also revealed a few surprises. “We saw broad swaths of the United States showing up. You see states like Colorado, Utah, Alaska in that top 10 list. That was a very interesting indicator for us,” said Willdorf. Coinbase also looked at states with the largest average value of cryptocurrency owned per person. Surprisingly, Delaware residents hold the highest average value of cryptocurrency per person, followed by California and Nevada. Wyoming (No. 6) and New Hampshire (No. 10) also made the list. So why are so many retail investors betting on bitcoin? “We spoke to one person, he’s saying that he’s looking to it as a way to drive his own economic freedom. He says this is something for ‘my generation’ this is something that’s giving us a new form of access,” said Willdorf. For others, having access to buy cryptocurrency without an “accredited investor” designation is also a motivator. Also, some like its association with technology, and the shape of things to come. “A young woman in New York tells us that this is really interesting and she thinks it’s going to be the wave of the future,” said Willdorf. Crypto is here to stay Even big banks are getting in on the digital currency hype. Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO David Solomon told France’s Les echos newspaper that he’s looking into ways to transform currencies or assets into tradeable digital contracts with blockchain. Also, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) said earlier this year it developed its own stable coin called JPM Coin. Lawmakers also want in on cryptocurrency, with more than 70% of U.S. states having enacted regulations governing cryptocurrency or blockchain technology, according to Coinbase. Cryptocurrencies may not be everybody’s cup of tea, but Willdorf says the numbers reveal it still has a lot of room to grow. “When you see 60% of Americans telling us in this survey that they’ve heard of Bitcoin, that number shows it’s both big and it also shows room to grow. When you see 15% across the country are saying they are interested in purchasing cryptocurrency,” she said.  Grete Suarez is producer at Yahoo Finance for YFi PM and The Ticker.

," Bitcoin Cash ABC rose by 4.11% on Monday. Partially reversing a 10.4% tumble from Sunday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $412.62. A relatively choppy day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rally to an early morning high $417.73 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level a $430.04 and 23.6% FIB of $418, Bitcoin Cash ABC slid to an intraday low $388.16. Steering clear of the first major support level at $379.47, Bitcoin Cash ABC found support late in the day to strike an intraday high $418.43. The 23.6% FIB of $418 limited the upside, leading to a pullback to $412 levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 0.23% to $413.58. A choppy start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise to a morning high $418.87 before sliding to a low $410.54. While leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin Cash ABC came up against the 23.6% FIB of $418.0. For the day ahead, a move through the 23.6% FIB of $418 to $420 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $424.65. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from $418 levels. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $420 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC hit reverse. A fall through to $405 levels would bring the first major support level at $394.38 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$380 levels. Litecoin rose by 0.42% on Monday. Partially reversing an 8.4% slide on Sunday, Litecoin ended the day at $122.54. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin rise to an early morning intraday high $126.52 before hitting reverse. Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $132.81, Litecoin fell to a late afternoon intraday low $113.13. The reversal saw Litecoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $117 and the first major support level at $115.30. Finding support late in the day, Litecoin broke back through the 23.6% FIB to $122 levels, reversing the losses on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 2.19% to $119.86. A bearish start to the day saw Litecoin fall from a morning high $123.41 to a low $119.35. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested in spite of the choppy start to the day. For the day ahead, a move back through the morning high to Monday’s high $126.52 would bring the first major resistance level at $128.33 into play. Litecoin would need to move back through to $121 levels by late morning, however, to support a rebound later in the day. Failure to move back through to $121 levels could see Litecoin fall deeper into the red. A fall through to $117 levels would bring the first major support level at $114.94 into play. Barring another crypto meltdown, Litecoin should steer clear of sub-$110 support levels on the day. Ripple’s XRP rose by 3.4% on Monday. Partially reversing a 7.4% fall from Sunday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.40806. A particularly bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rally from an intraday low $0.39013 to an early morning intraday high $0.41971. Steering clear of the major support levels, Ripple’s XRP broke through the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164 and first major resistance level at $0.4177. A sell-off through the morning through to the late afternoon saw Ripple’s XRP slide back to $0.39049 before finding support. A late move back through to $0.40 levels saw Ripple’s XRP avoid another day in the red. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 1.21% to $0.40311. A choppy start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP hit a morning high $0.41187 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the major resistance levels and 23.6% FIB of $0.4164, Ripple’s XRP fell to a morning low $0.40240. In spite of the early pullback, Ripple’s XRP held above the first major support level at $0.3922. For the day ahead, a move back through to $0.4060 levels would support a rebound. Ripple’s XRP would need support from the broader market, however, to take a run at the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP would likely fall well short of the first major resistance level at $0.4218. Failure to move through to $0.4060 levels could see Ripple’s XRP slide deeper into the red. A fall to sub-$0.40 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.3922 into play.

As such, Iran's Power Ministry could implement a tariff on miners, according to Bloomberg.

1," Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, briefly broke the $9,000 resistance level Thursday afternoon the first time since May 2018.  Soon after the cryptocurrency broke through $9,000, it shed $500 as per data provided by crypto exchange Coinbase. At last check, it was trading at $8,573 per coin. The volatile asset has been on a tear since the beginning of the year, nearly tripling in value from its bottom below $3,200 at the end of 2018. It's not exactly clear what has been behind bitcoin's impressive price action. Still, there have been some positive signs, including the entrance of larger players into the market, such as Fidelity and Intercontinental Exchange.  Options trading suggest the price of bitcoin could surge even higher.

13," A Reddit user has posted his version of the maths required for a future $10 million Bitcoin valuation. His assumptions are based on a number of factors including the global amount of millionaires, a $260 trillion stock and derivative market, and Bitcoin’s intrinsically scarce supply schedule. BuyBitcoinWhileItsLo started his post by reminding people about the “fundamental fact that only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist”, and that unlike the dollar (which can be printed continuously forever), a Bitcoin is infinitely divisible – “So no matter how expensive one coin gets, infinite fractions of it can be purchased and used.” BuyBitcoinWhileItsLo estimated that “there are 36 million millionaires in the world today”, and “by the time every one of them tries to grab a full Bitcoin when it becomes a must-have investment, there won’t be enough for all of them”. In the Reddit post – which was titled “My best attempt to simplify the math of a 10 million dollar Bitcoin” – the user predicted that this would “easily push one coin past 1 million dollars in value when they [the millionaires] try to grab a whole coin”. Regarding traditional markets, he said “there is $260 trillion in the global stock markets through stocks and derivatives”, or “what others call institutional money”. “Once Bitcoin is allowed to be traded for stocks, that $260 trillion is open to be put behind Bitcoin.” The Reddit user said that when this happens: “$260 trillion divided by 21 million Bitcoins puts one Bitcoin over $10 million a coin, or $12 million a coin to be exact.” “This will likely happen in our lifetime. That makes every dollar invested even at an $11,000 price could be worth $1,000 in possibly 10 years at this rate.” Moving on to the topic of Bitcoin’s supply schedule, BuyBitcoinWhileItsLo said: “Every four years the distribution of Bitcoin going out gets cut in half. So in the first four years 10.5 million Bitcoins went out, and the demand was small so the price was cheap – it went from less than a penny in 2009 to $1,000 in 2013 when it first halved.” “That’s where we are now. So currently only 5.25 million Bitcoins are going out, which is why the price is running up since investors know this, and they always start to buy before a halving to grab coins before there is less to go out.” The Reddit user said: “The next halving is next year – summer 2020. After that, only 2.125 million Bitcoins will be going out with $10 trillion in institutional markets being opened up. The potential is anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000 in the short term by late 2020 or early 2021, then another 80+% drop as usual.” The Bitcoin bull concluded: “At the current prices, you’re in a good position to be fine after the next correction/drop that’ll come after the upcoming halving skyrockets the price. I for one won’t stop accumulating till we break $20,000. My golden rule is to never buy during all-time highs.”   The post Bitcoin: The route to $10 million appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Nawaz Sulemanji,Coin Rivet,2019-06-24T12:05:26.000Z

Latest Bitcoin price and analysis (BTC to USD)," At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $7,700 after price spiked during the weekend, climbing from $7,450 to almost $8,200. BTC is trading above its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day EMAs after a massive spike in price earlier in May which took Bitcoin through the roof on almost all exchanges. I’m hopeful the trend will continue for the time being, but there may well be another pullback on the horizon which could take BTC back to $5,800-$6,200. Of course, as more time passes, the less likely this becomes. Traders say the trend is your friend until the end. As of the middle of March, it seems we’ve been continually accumulating at higher prices, meaning we are definitely following a bullish trend. Let’s take a look at what’s going on with the Bitcoin markets. Bitcoin experienced a minor rally that took its price upwards close to 10% over the weekend. Afterwards, price pulled back closer to its support levels. At the moment, the market is moving upwards with higher lows each time it falls. Even though BTC is accumulating close to the $8,000 region, price wants to grow past $9,000. The more an asset tests a given level, the higher the chances are it will eventually break it. Just don’t forget it works both ways. This means if we see Bitcoin touching the $7,000 – $7,200 level again, it could mean it will retrace back to its 20-day EMA. I therefore advise traders to be very careful when entering new positions at the moment. Support levels above the crucial long-term zone are now found near $7,400 and $7,250, while below the $6,850 level, further strong support is found near $6,200, where the 50-day EMA is currently sitting. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that, I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now in charge. Volume-wise, we are reaching record highs again, even though current volumes are thin and a pullback has the greatest likelihood. I personally would like the price of Bitcoin to continue shooting to the moon, but retracements are expected! Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $10,000 by the end of 2019. Later this week, I’ll release an article discussing how crypto adoption is growing, which will clearly help push prices. If you don’t immediately understand why, let’s ask Mati Greenspan what he thinks: Facebook coin isn't a competitor to Bitcoin, it's a competitor to the Dollar. — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) June 9, 2019  Hopefully the market will continue this positive momentum.

," Open your FXTM account today Investors wasted to no time rushing back to the crypto asset on rumours revolving around Facebook launching its own cryptocurrency. Market optimism about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies becoming widely accepted and adopted by mainstream entities could inspire bulls to target $10,000 in the medium to longer term. While the path of least resistance for Bitcoin currently points north amid the positivity, investors should not overlook how inherently volatile and unpredictable cryptocurrencies can be. Focusing on the technical picture, BTCUSD remains bullish on the daily charts. A solid daily close above $9300 should invite a move higher towards $9500 and $9700, respectively. Should $9000 prove to be unreliable support, Bitcoin is seen sinking back towards $8000.

3," Andreas Antonopoulos doesn’t have much hope for the decentralisation claims of the upcoming Facebook cryptocurrency, but he does think that it may be the first in a new wave of Silicon Valley coins set to directly compete against an established set of incumbent banking giants. Speaking to a packed house at the recent London Coinscrum meetup, the open source advocate hypothesised that Facebook may be planning “an open network where anyone can join”, but soon the company is going to run into a couple of legal constraints. Antonopoulos mocked the true intentions of the social media platform, saying: “If they can build a truly decentralised and permissionless coin, then I will join the board of directors.” Can't wait for a cryptocurrency with the ethics of Uber, the censorship resistance of Paypal, and the centralization of Visa, all tied together under the proven privacy of Facebook. https://t.co/C4FymDjtFw — Sarah Jamie Lewis (@SarahJamieLewis) June 14, 2019  He exclaimed that “Facebook can’t do that” as “they’re not an open source project”. He then went on to pull apart Facebook’s current business model, saying: “They’re not today operating across different countries. They have legal jurisdiction in specific countries, and in those specific countries, there are laws about what you can and can’t do with money.” According to Andreas, these are “laws that Bitcoin doesn’t have to deal with” because it’s an open source and decentralised project. Queues for @aantonop's book signing @coinscrum pic.twitter.com/BokX8b9mQn — Coinscrum (@coinscrum) June 13, 2019  He said: “First they are going to have a committee inside Facebook, and they’re going to say let’s build a completely open, decentralised cryptocurrency, and the lawyers at Facebook (who outnumber everybody) are going to go whoa, we can’t allow that. “They can’t be borderless because they have to abide by the regulations that prohibit transfers of money across borders without know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.” Antonopoulos believes that Facebook will have to vet every participant in the transaction and the social media giant “can’t be neutral because they can’t just transfer value from anyone to anyone for any purpose”. Due to these factors, he summarised: “Facebook cannot build an open, decentralised cryptocurrency because they’re prevented by law – no company can do what Bitcoin does. “So who they are really competing with and who should be terrified by this are banks. Banks are currently now squeezed between a rock and a hard place – or a Bitcoin and a Facecoin. “On the one hand, they’ve got an open and decentralised zoo of cryptocurrencies that they can’t plan, they can’t compete, they can’t co-opt, they can’t sue, they can’t buy, and they can’t even get the government to shut it down (even though they have been trying). “The thing that they pride themselves on the most is being progressive technology companies. If you think Facecoin is coming, so is Apple coin, Amazon coin, Twitter coin, Uber coin, and AirBnB coin, and every other Silicon Valley corporation.” Antonopoulos believes that every company is going to get into this space eventually, especially if Facebook shows it to be profitable and successful. With many banks now offering the same fundamental financial services to consumers, they are not going to stand a chance against a whole bunch of Silicon Valley tech giants who already know how to do “user experience and user interface better”. The open blockchain advocate thinks that the best part of this “is that they [the banks] have to compete with these [Silicon Valley] giants that will actually have perfected the art of using artificial intelligence to tickle your dopamine receptors”, and now “they’re going to deliver banking to you”. He thinks this may lead to a “horrific surveillance capitalism” where all of your payment information will be sold “to everyone, everywhere”, leading to the destruction of privacy and democracy in all developed countries. With a tongue-in-cheek taunt to the fiat banking industry, Antonopoulos concluded: “For the banks, it’s even worse. Their profit margins are going to go down by at least 8% – and that’s serious.” The post Andreas Antonopoulos believes banks are about to ‘lose a whole generation of customers’ appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Nawaz Sulemanji,Coin Rivet,2019-06-17T12:00:04.000Z

At the recent Malta AI and Blockchain Summit, Coin Rivet caught up with Irina Heaver of Bolton Holding. A lawyer with over 15 years experience in the corporate world, she is now working with many large businesses in the process of tokenisation from her office at the top of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Her entry into the world of blockchain began through IBM bringing blockchain to the shipping world, which convinced her that “blockchain has amazing commercial applications for businesses. I do believe blockchain can bring more to business than just cryptocurrency.” According to Irina, her current employer – Bolton Holding – is “a traditional business”. She states: “We are an alternative investment group. We have real business. We have real assets such as gold and diamond mines. We also do a lot of commodities trading. We invest in financial services. We are building a bank in the UAE. We use a lot of emerging tech.” The emerging technology doesn’t just stop at blockchain though. “We also implement machine learning and AI in our operations,” she enthuses. The main aim of Bolton Holding as a traditional business is “to bring more value to our shareholders and investors”. During our chat, the most fascinating prospect Irina discussed is the potential tokenisation of one of the world’s biggest football clubs. “We are looking at a certain major club. They asked us to get involved and we are looking at how we can bring value not only for the shareholders and the players, but also the community. The beauty of tokenisation is creating the community and creating the benefits for the community,” says Irina. But how would this work exactly? “Imagine a tokenomics model where as a fan you get rewarded for good behaviour and punished for bad behaviour. If you get rewarded with the token of the club, this could give you an opportunity to meet your favourite player or to be invited to the next event. It’s a very interesting proposition we are working on, but it’s a bit early to say. Watch that space!” Although Irina didn’t specify which club it is she’s working with just yet, she did drop some hints in the video interview, which will be on Coin Rivet’s YouTube page shortly. While we often hear of how cryptocurrency and blockchain is progressing in the Western world and how it can help citizens in states such as Venezuela, the Middle East largely goes unnoticed, despite the popularity of the technology in the region. Irina notes: “We have a huge scene there. We have a blockchain centre and cryptocurrency meet-ups. We also work with banks educating employees on what cryptocurrency is. What I do is very simple. I will grab your phone and install a wallet and send you $5 of Bitcoin to show you how easy it is. Then they call back and ask how we can get more and ask more. It is an educational process.” The process of tokenising many large businesses, including a major football club, is a fascinating proposition. Whilst many in the cryptocurrency scene view Bitcoin as a harbinger of death for traditional business and banks, Irina is instead helping these corporations modernise with the times.

15," It’s been a bearish start to the month of June as the bears look to claw back control of the reins. Bitcoin fell by 0.95% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 2.36% gain from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $7,924.0. Bearish through most of the day, Bitcoin fell from an early morning intraday high $8,069.0 to a late afternoon intraday low $7,800.1. Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $8,178.63, Bitcoin came within range of the first major support level at $7,791.53 before finding late support. For the current week, Monday through Saturday, Bitcoin was down by 9.34% in spite of 3 consecutive days in the green mid-week. A bearish start to the week did the damage, with Bitcoin seeing heavy losses in the first 2-days of the week. In spite of the bearish week, Bitcoin managed to hold above the 23.6% FIB of $7,718 and touch $8,000 levels before reversing. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed bag for the pack. Bucking the trend from across the broader market, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash SV held onto gains through the current week. Monday through Saturday, Litecoin led the way with a 3.33% gain, with Bitcoin Cash SV up by 2.63%. Elsewhere, it was a sea of red. Leading the way down was EOS, which had tumbled by 17.6%. Bitcoin Cash ABC was a distant second, sliding by 11.5%. Ethereum (-9.3%), Stellar’s Lumen (-8.7%) and Ripple’s XRP (-8.1%) were also deep in the red for the week. The sell-off through the current week came as 24-hour trading volumes fell from $72bn levels at the start of the week to $57bn levels at the time of writing. The total crypto market cap slid from $275bn levels to $250bn levels at the time of writing. On the rankings, EOS’s heavy losses in the week led to a fall to the number 6 spot. Litecoin’s trend-bucking moves led to a move through to the number 4 spot, with Bitcoin Cash ABC at number 5. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.73% to $7,865.8. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning high $7,963.3 to a low $7,851.5. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested in the early part of the day. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash SV, EOS and Litecoin saw the heaviest losses in the early hours. Bitcoin Cash SV led the way, down by 2.82% at the time of writing. EOS and Litecoin were down by 1.73% and 1.97% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move through to $7,930 to support a run at the first major resistance level at $8,061.30. The sentiment from across the broader market would need to materially improve, however, for Bitcoin to move back through to $7,900 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, Bitcoin would likely come up short of $8,000 levels. Failure to move through to $7,930 levels could see Bitcoin fall deeper into the red. A fall back through the morning low $7,851.5 would bring the first major support level at $7,793.4 into play. Barring an extended crypto sell-off through the day, Bitcoin would likely steer clear of sub-$7,700 levels.

Monero Technical Analysis – Resistance Levels in Play – 01/07/19," How to Buy Monero’s XMR Monero’s XMR tumbled by 12.1% on Sunday. Following on from a 1.77% loss on Saturday, Monero’s XMR ended the week down 23.5% at $87.68. The last week of June sell-off left Monero’s XMR down by 6.1% for the month. Bearish through the morning, Monero’s XMR slid from an early intraday high $100.39 to a late afternoon low $89.5. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Monero’s XMR fell through the first major support level at $94.47. Finding support at the second major support level at $89.13, Monero’s XMR recovered to $94 levels before a late sell-off. The late sell-off saw Monero’s XMR fall through the first major support level and second major support level at $89.13. Of greater significance on the day was the fall through the 23.6% FIB of $99. For Monero’s XMR, the extended bearish trend formed at late April 2018’s swing hi $298 remained intact. The pullback through the 23.6% FIB of $99 reaffirmed the extended bearish trend, following 15th December’s swing lo $37.18. For the bulls, a move back through the 23.6% FIB of $99 to $115 levels would be needed to support a run at $140 levels. A move through the 38.2% FIB would see Monero’s XMR form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Monero’s XMR was up by 1.92% to $89.36. A relatively bullish day saw Monero’s XMR rise from a morning low $87.13 to a high $90.37 before easing back. Monero’s XMR left the major support and resistance levels and the 23.6% FIB of $99 untested early on. A move through the morning high $90.37 to $91.6 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $96.50. Monero’s XMR would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from $92 levels on the day. In the event of an extended crypto rally through the day, the 23.6% FIB of $99 would likely leave Monero’s XMR short of Sunday’s high $100.39. Failure to move through to $91.6 levels could see Monero’s XMR hit reverse. A fall through the morning low $87.13 would bring the first major support level at $82.74 into play. Barring another crypto meltdown, Monero’s XMR should steer clear of sub-$80 support levels on the day.

1," The recently launched FiatMarketCap.com lets you imagine a future where Bitcoin is the de facto global store of value. The new go-to tracker “monitors fiat currency market caps in BTC” using measures like the M2 or M3 money supply of nation-state currencies. The different bands of money supply are typically classified as “Ms”. The “Ms” usually range from M0 (the narrowest) to M3 as the broadest classification of total money supply for fiat currencies. Launched website to monitor fiat currency market caps in BTC:https://t.co/U5LilHjxSB  This will be an ongoing exercise tracking Bitcoin's rise against major fiat currencies. — FiatMarketCap (@fiatmarketcap) June 13, 2019  What types of assets are classified into each band of money supply tend to differ according to different central banks, but to give an example, the Eurozone uses the following definitions:   The new website’s “Fiat Currency” tab lists the market cap and price (in BTC) with the nominal amount of fiat currency in total circulation for 116 state-backed currencies. All the currencies have a “max supply” set as “unlimited” – except of course number 35 in the list (Bitcoin) which has a total supply of just 21 million BTC. If you click on the “Countries” tab, you can again see a list of 140 currencies, but this time next to the market cap and circulating supply. You can also see the measure and date of the last money supply audit for each sovereign currency. Topping the leaderboard today is the Chinese yuan, with a market cap of just under 3 billion BTC, or around $27 trillion when priced in USD. Coming in at number two is the US dollar, which the website measures at a market cap of just over 1.6 billion BTC (or $14 trillion). Today you can see that Bitcoin has the 35th biggest market cap on the site ($163 billion). When looking at the Countries tab, BTC is tracking all the way down in 47th place. As Bitcoin’s market cap continues its ascent, it will be interesting to see how this fun experiment will continue to track Bitcoin’s rise against major fiat currencies – watch this space!

"Market Morning: No China Promises, Democrats Debate, New Age Crossfire, Russian Stocks Bullish"," Asian Stocks Down, Europe Berates Iran on Nuclear Deal Chinese stocks (NYSEARCA:ASHR) are down this morning on news that President Trump didn’t actually promise Chinese President Xi Jinping a six-month hiatus on new tariffs, as widely reported in the media yesterday. So 25% tariffs on $300 billion Chinese goods coming into the US could come into effect at any time, possibly even right after the Trump/Xi talks end following the G20 meeting this weekend. Since signs are pointing to a global economic slowdown gathering momentum, this would be the first time since the 1930’s that significant tariffs would be instituted on the cusp of an economic recession. SEE: Canadian CBD Firm Alternate Health Acquires Blaine Labs On the Iranian front, Europe wants Iran to keep to its part of the nuclear deal, even though Iran isn’t getting anything it wants out of the nuclear deal, which is a lack of sanctions. Europe is forced to comply with these sanctions or risk being kicked off of the SWIFT international banking system, so there isn’t much that Iran is getting out of sticking to the old accords. Nevertheless, European officials urged Iran to do just that. “We will repeat to the Iranians that nuclear issues are not negotiable. We want them to stay in the accord, but we won’t accept them messing us around,” a senior European diplomat said. As to what will be done if Iran is “messing us around”, no word on that. Democrats Meet for Second Debate, Talk About Trump, Love Democratic party candidates gathered for a second debate last night, where they discussed, among other things, how to beat Donald Trump. One original idea came from Marianne Williamson, a candidate who has never before held any public office, but decided to channel Jackie DeShannon’s 1965 hit, “What the World Needs Now Is Love” maybe in an appeal to Baby Boomers. Williamson promised to “meet [Trump] on that field [of politics]” and “harness love for political purposes” emphasizing that “love will win”. Cheers erupted in the crowd on the prospect of victorious political love. Other highlights included front runner and former Vice President Joe Biden being excoriated for preventing California Senator Kamala Harris from being bused to school as a kid, and promising that if elected president, he would focus on, of all things, defeating Donald Trump. If Biden picks Williamson as his running mate, there might just be enough love to accomplish that, as long as Biden offers Harris a seat on the bus on the way to dropping her off at the Senate. New Age Beverages Gets Whipsawed In Short/Long Debate New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) is in the spotlight in the cannabis sector this week, as conflicting reports have been released regarding the company. Grizzly Research reports that New Age may have been duped into buying a dying firm called Morinda, which it paid $75 million for in cash back in December, plus $10M in stock. Morinda is a multi-level marketing company in China, and Grizzly accuses it of inflating its financials with Morinda reporting higher figures that those it logged with Chinese regulators. However, New Age maintains that the report is inaccurate, but has yet to release a detailed rebuttal. New Age logged a loss of $1.6 million last quarter, posting record revenues of $58 million, and its stock remains on the low end of a trading range established last September. Shares remain in a long term uptrend since 2016. Putin Bashes Liberals While Russian Stocks Threaten to Break Out “[Liberals] cannot simply dictate anything to anyone just like they have been attempting to do over the recent decades,” Russian President Vladimir Putin was quoted as saying during a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May. “The liberal idea has become obsolete. It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population.” Also, the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil with a nerve agent shouldn’t be considered a big deal. On the financial front in Russia, Russian stocks (NYSEARCA:ERUS) are threatening to break out to the upside, now at the highest levels since 2014, with the Ruble appearing to have been stabilized in a trading range ever since the oil collapse of that year that brought Russian stocks down in the first place. In signs that its economy is stabilizing, private sector credit loans are at record highs despite interest rates at 7.5%, and a bout of inflation appears to be under control, topping out at about 17% annual in 2015. Bitcoin Crash 3.0 Up Ahead As Volatility Explodes Bitcoin (BTC-USD) continues its epic earthquake, again, for the third time since 2013. Prices were as high as $13,756 on June 26 and fell to as low as $10,701 today, but are now back up to $11,863 at time of writing, but could be literally anywhere by the time you read this. Total market cap for all cryptocurrencies is down $50 billion since June 26 and remains 60% below all time highs set in December 2017, so we are nowhere near resuming a bull market, at least in price, if not in time. What the current volatility shows, once again, is that cryptocurrency values in dollar terms are not dependent on any sort of current events. MarketWatch columnist Mark Hulbert believes that there is an 80% chance that Bitcoin prices will crash. He bases this prediction on the rate of its recent rise, which has been parabolic. He doesn’t give a bottom call to his predictions, which are basically taken from a different paper, though the most recent Bitcoin bottom came in at around $3,200 depending on the exchange you’re using to gauge price.   The post Market Morning: No China Promises, Democrats Debate, New Age Crossfire, Russian Stocks Bullish appeared first on Market Exclusive.",ME Staff,Market Exclusive,2019-06-28T11:30:19.000Z

," Bitcoin Cash ABC fell by 4.48% on Tuesday. Reversing a 1.1% gain from Monday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $412.0. A particularly bearish day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC slide from a start of a day intraday high $431.31 to a late intraday low $403.61. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the first major support level at $424.75 and second major support level at $418.18. The third major support level at $403.99 prevented heavier losses on the day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 0.34% to $413.40. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise to a morning high $415.0 before easing to a low $411.12. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move back through the morning high $415 to $418 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $427.67. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $420. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin Cash ABC could return to $430 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the morning high could see Bitcoin Cash ABC hit reverse. A slide through the morning low $411.12 to sub-$410 levels would bring the first major support level at $400 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC will likely steer clear of sub-$400 levels on the day. Litecoin rose by 0.67% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 2.04% fall on Monday, Litecoin ended the day at $135.1. A relatively choppy day saw Litecoin slide to a mid-morning intraday low $128.91 before finding support. Litecoin fell through the first major support level at $131.71 to test the second major support level at $129.2. An early afternoon rebound saw Litecoin strike an intraday high $136.98 to come within range of the first major resistance level at $137.06. A pullback to $131 levels was short-lived, with Litecoin managing to move back into positive territory late in the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 0.13% to $135.28. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a morning low $133.59 to a high $135.6. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold above $133 levels through the morning would support a bullish day ahead. A move through Tuesday’s high $136.98 would bring the first major resistance level at $138.42 into play. Litecoin would need support from the broader market, however, for a break out from $137 levels. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Litecoin could take a run at $139 levels before any pullback. Failure to hold above $133 levels could see Litecoin slide back through the morning low $133.59 to $130 levels. Barring a crypto meltdown, the first major support level at $130.35 should limit the downside on the day.

Bitfinex also recently announced that it is ready to ship a derivatives product with up to 100x leverage. BitMEX also offers a similar product with up to 100x leverage on its Bitcoin perpetual swap contract.

A bullish morning saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rally from an intraday low $415.28 to a late morning intraday high $444.0. Steering clear of the first major support level at $406.01, Bitcoin Cash ABC broke through the major resistance levels. A slide back to $423 levels in the early afternoon was the only bearish move of the day before recovering to $430 levels. Bitcoin Cash ABC broke back through the second major resistance level at $425.48. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 0.84% to $440.29.

In spite of the early move, Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested. For the day ahead, a move back through the morning high $442.0 would support a run at the first major resistance level at $448.64. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin Cash ABC to break out from Friday’s high $444.0. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin Cash ABC could touch $450 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the morning high $442.0 could see Bitcoin Cash ABC hit reverse. A fall through the morning low $436.65 would bring $420 levels into play before any recovery.

Reversing a 0.5% decline on Thursday, Litecoin ended the business week up 1.49% to $139.04. Tracking the broader market, Litecoin rallied from a morning low $135.83 to a late morning intraday high $141.53. Litecoin broke through the first major resistance level at $137.64 and second major resistance level at $139.28. An early afternoon reversal saw Litecoin slide to an intraday low $135.35 before finding support. Steering clear of the first major support level at $133.86, Litecoin recovered to $139 levels late in the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 0.55% to $138.27. A bearish start to the day saw Litecoin fall from a morning high $139.32 to a low $138.04. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move back through to $138.70 levels would support a return to $140 levels later in the day. Litecoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break through the first major resistance level at $141.93. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Friday’s high $141.53 and the first major resistance level would likely limit any upside on the day. Failure to move back through to $138.70 levels could see Litecoin slide deeper into the red. A fall through to $136 levels would bring the first major support level at $135.75 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Litecoin would likely steer clear of sub-$130 levels. The second major support level at $132.46 should limit any downside on the day. Ripple’s XRP gained 3.28% on Friday. Reversing a 0.8% fall from Thursday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.44610. For the current week, Ripple’s XRP was up by 4.13%. A bullish morning saw Ripple’s XRP rally from an intraday low $0.43133 to a late morning intraday high $0.45123. Ripple’s XRP broke through the first major resistance level at $0.4400 and second major resistance level at $0.4473. A pullback to $0.43 levels in the early afternoon was short-lived, with Ripple’s XRP recovering to $0.44 levels to hold above the first major resistance level at $0.4400. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 0.43% to $0.44416. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from a morning high $0.44616 to a low $0.44322 before steadying. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold above $0.4430 through the morning would support a recovery later in the day. Ripple’s XRP would need to move through the morning high $0.44616, however, to break back through to $0.45 levels. In the event of a rebound, Ripple’s XRP would likely test the first major resistance level at $0.4544. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP will likely fall short of the second major resistance level at $0.4628. Failure to move back through the morning high could see Ripple’s XRP slide to $0.43 levels before any recovery. The first major support level at $0.4345 should limit the downside on the day.

3," Bitcoin is once more looking bullish as the world’s biggest decentralised asset has found a new influx of buying support to rally close to 20% in price since the start of July. On a backdrop of global turmoils driven by a narrative of trade tensions, a breakout in the gold and commodities markets, and even US President Donald Trump calling out China and Europe specifically for currency manipulation, could this be the perfect storm for Bitcoin to break past resistance and head upwards to fresh 2019 highs? China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for many years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019  Long-time Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos has reminded the community that governments may soon try and “blame crypto for the currency war”, but “the race to the bottom” for state-backed fiat currencies has little to do with the disruptive asset class. Towards the end of last week, Bitcoin continued to grind to defend its five-figure valuation. Unlike other downward price movements that we have seen of late, Bitcoin’s move down did not include any large-scale sell-offs, but instead a series of mini-dumps taking the price down from $12,000 to $10,000. Since this local bottom was hit, we have seen volumes pick up and buyers come back into the market to drive the price back up to the same level where the ‘controlled’ sell-off began. If Bitcoin can now penetrate through the $12,000-$12,400 level of resistance, the move back up to $14,000 and beyond may be quicker than its initial parabolic rise in late June. If the digitally-scarce asset does decide to rally up from this point, the odds of ever seeing an exchange-traded price of under $10,000 will decrease exponentially as fast as any potential move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency. That is why we are all here.  Anything short of this becomes much less interesting. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 4, 2019    The popular Bitcoin analyst Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano recently outlined his $100,000 Bitcoin target for the end of 2021, but the chances are that if we do see all-time highs broken sooner rather than later, a six-figure valuation for Bitcoin may become a reality quicker than even the most bullish commentators in the space would ever expect.

Kraken exec believes that institutional money is coming to Bitcoin ‘whether they realise it or not’," At the recent CryptoCompare conference in London, Coin Rivet had the chance to catch up with Kraken business development manager Austin Alexander, who shared his thoughts on the entry of institutional money into the decentralised asset economy. Austin started out by telling us that institutional money will come eventually because Bitcoin will continue to grow as it’s “the best money that’s ever been created”. He said: “If they want to come now or they want to come next year or they want to wait 10 years, the sooner the better for these institutions. But there’s infinite fiat out there. There’s infinite slave money, so that’s great.” The Bitcoin OG and co-founder of the New York Bitcoin Centre reminded us that “there’s only 21 million Bitcoin” and that this is the metric that exchanges should be planning their business models around. He added: “The supply side is what is most important to go after because Bitcoin is amazing – the bad money will chase the good money.” The Kraken exec – whose exchange regularly sees volume of over $200 million a day – told us: “If you have coins on your marketplace, if you have that liquidity, you have that supply. “All these exchanges that have focused on institutional investors or being the top regulated marketplace, they’re all the least liquid exchanges out there.” However, the four-year company veteran told us that some unnamed established exchanges may be an exception to this rule, but only because of “the near monopoly they had on retail banking – at least back then”. He exclaimed that if an exchange is now exclusively targeting an institutional investor base, it is a “losing strategy from the start”. Building on and with Bitcoin seems to be the way to go according to Alexander. It was recently revealed that Kraken was sending Bitcoin salary payments to over 250 employees across the world. On this topic, Austin said: “We have a lot of people who are somewhat remote digital nomads. If you’re travelling or living in places outside of the kind of banked West, it’s better to have Bitcoin as it works better than the US dollar.” We respect the quest for sound money but @PeterSchiff is wrong when he says ""there is no way that people are going to work for salaries paid in bitcoin"". Kraken paid 250 salaries in bitcoin in April and more employees are opting for crypto every month. https://t.co/OZuh4gcbfw — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) May 23, 2019  Austin passionately concluded that “Bitcoin is what’s important if you build on it”. “The focus should be on the supply side, on catering to the coins – the institutions don’t have coins. They have fiat, which is garbage money. It is slave money. It is infinite money. “If you build for that audience, they’re coming, whether they realise it or not. Whether they like it or not, they will follow the coins, not the other way around.” For more news, guides, and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.

Craig Wright tells federal court he is unable to access $10 billion bitcoin fortune," Craig Wright, the leading proponent of Bitcoin SV who says he is the creator of Bitcoin, claimed in Florida federal court on Friday that he is unable to easily access the $10 billion bitcoin fortune or even produce the addresses at which the coins are stored. Wright is in court to defend himself against the estate of his former business partner Dave Kleiman, which claims he stole bitcoin belonging to Kleiman. Wright claimed that Kleiman was responsible for hiding the bitcoin jointly owned by the two men in order to protect Wright's identity as the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. According to Wright, ""I brought in Dave because he was a friend and he knew who I was and he was a forensic expert, and I wanted to wipe everything I had to do with Bitcoin from the public record."" Kleiman's estate is highly motivated to retrieve the bitcoin, while Wright claims that his family has ""enough now"" and the missing bitcoin would be ""too much money."" The estate claims that Wright forged a significant number of documents following Kleiman's death in 2013 in order to transfer to himself all of the jointly owned bitcoin. Wright reportedly became emotional in the courtroom, which was cleared of any electronic devices, and lamented that his purported monetary creation was used for illicit activities on Silk Road and elsewhere. As a result, Wright says he stopped mining and working on Bitcoin in 2010. If Wright and Kleiman's estate really do own the bitcoin they're claiming, both have much at stake in the proceedings, as the value of bitcoin owned by the elusive creator of the cryptocurrency is now worth well over $10 billion. And with Wright currently leading Bitcoin SV, valued at nearly $4 billion, he can ill afford to have his reputation sullied at trial. During the hearing, Wright turned combative on a number of occasions, throwing a document and using profane language. This caused the judge to warn Wright that he would be ""in handcuffs"" if he did not get himself under control.  The hearing concluded with the matter far from settled. It will reportedly be continued later this summer.",The Block,None,2019-06-29T13:14:15.000Z
1," Bitcoin Cash ABC rose by 0.46% on Friday. Partially reversing a 5% slide from Thursday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $400.0. A choppy day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC slide to a mid-morning intraday low $393.06 before finding support. Steering clear of the first major support level at $390.63, Bitcoin Cash ABC rallied to a late morning intraday high $411.50. In spite of the upswing, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell short of the first major resistance level at $413.25 and 23.6% FIB of $418. Easing back through the afternoon, Bitcoin Cash ABC slid back to $396 levels before a late recovery to $400 levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 1.13% to $404.5. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $400.67 to a high $404.5. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold above $401.5 would support a run at the first major resistance level at $409.98. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the continued support of the broader market, however, to take a run on Thursday’s high $411.5. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin Cash ABC would likely fall short of recovery through the 23.6% FIB of $418.0. Failure to hold above $401.5 could see Bitcoin Cash ABC test the first major support level at $391.54. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$390 support levels on the day. Litecoin fell by 0.79% on Friday. Following on from a 1.8% fall from Thursday, Litecoin ended the day at $118.54. A choppy morning saw Litecoin fall to a low $116.88 before striking a late morning intraday high $120.85. The early pullback saw Litecoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $117 to come within range of the first major support level at $116.62. In spite of rebound, Litecoin fell short of the first major resistance level at $124.96. Pulling back through the afternoon, Litecoin fell back through the 23.6% FIB to an intraday low $116.56. Litecoin tested the first major support level at $116.62 for a 2nd time on the day before a recovering to $119 levels. A late pullback saw Litecoin fall back into the red for the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up 1.28% to $120.06. Tracking the broader market, Litecoin rose from a morning low $118.41 to a high $120.79 before easing back. Steering clear of the major support levels, the first major resistance level at $120.74 pinned Litecoin back early on. For the day ahead, a hold above $118 levels would support another move through the first major resistance level at $120.74. Litecoin would need support from the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $122.94. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Thursday’s high $120.85 and the first major resistance level would likely limit any upside. Failure to hold above $118 levels could see Litecoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $117. The first major support level at $116.45 would likely limit any downside.

," Bitcoin slid by 4.72% on Thursday. Following on from a 0.69% fall on Wednesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $8,270. A 3rd consecutive day in the red left Bitcoin down by 5.27% for the current week. While the bears look to take back control, the bulls delivered in the month of May. Bitcoin was up by 47.7% for the current month. On the day, a relatively bullish morning saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $8,537.5 to a high $8,819.7 before easing back to $8,700 levels. An early afternoon rally saw Bitcoin strike an intraday high and new swing hi $9,109.0. Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $8,831.33 and second major resistance level at $8,984.67 before hitting reverse. A broad-based crypto sell-off saw Bitcoin slide to a late intraday low $8,005 before finding support. The reversal saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level at $8,489.83 and second major support level at $8,301.67. Key on the day was a hold onto $8,000 levels, though Bitcoin was unable to break back through the support levels by the day end. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red on the day, with even Binance Coin unable to buck the trend. Leading the way down was Bitcoin Cash SV, which tumbled by 11.68%. The reversal barely made a dent into the current month gains, with Bitcoin Cash SV up by 74.2% for May. EOS and Bitcoin Cash ABC also saw heavy losses, the pair down by 8.95% and 7.79% on the day. The Thursday reversal left the majors split for the current week. While Bitcoin Cash SV led the way, EOS (+4.81%) and Ripple’s XRP (+2.28%) were the only other majors in positive territory for the week. Leading the way down were Binance Coin and Bitcoin, with losses of 5.6% and 5.3% respectively. In spite of the mixed performance in the week, it’s been a particularly bullish month, however. Leading the charge was Bitcoin Cash SV, which surged by 240% through the current month. Bitcoin Cash ABC came in a distant second, up by 60%. Trailing the pack with relatively minor gains were Stellar’s Lumen (20.98%) and Ripple’s XRP (28.88%). Having hit a week high $286.55bn on Thursday, the total crypto market cap fell back to $258bn levels off the back of Thursday’s afternoon sell-off. In spite of the slide, 24-hour volumes have returned to $100bn levels at the time of writing, though this time around investors are looking to lock in profits. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.53% to $8,143.1. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to a morning high $8,367 before sliding to a morning low $8,142.6. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested in the early hours. Elsewhere, it was red across the board for the crypto top 10. Leading the way down were Binance Coin (-3.31%), Ethereum (-3.28%) and Bitcoin Cash SV (-3.24%).  For the Day Ahead, Bitcoin would need to move back through the morning high $8,367 to $8,460 levels to support a recovery of Thursday’s losses. Sentiment across the broader market would need to materially improve, however, for Bitcoin to recover the early losses. In the event of a cryptomarket rebound, a move through to $8,460 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $8,917.7 into play. Failure to move back through the morning high $8,367 would see Bitcoin sit in the red through the day. A slide through to Thursday’s low $8,005 would bring sub-$8.000 levels into play before any recovery. Barring another crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin would likely steer clear of the first major support level at $7,813.67.

18," At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading just above $11,055 after price crashed close to 23% from $13,800 to $10,500 during the weekend. It seems the hypothesis that weekends are good for Bitcoin may not always be true, even though Bitcoin price is now higher than it was one week ago as BTC consolidated above the key $11,000 level during Sunday. Will Bitcoin bounce back? Or will we see more major retracements back to the $7,000 – $8,000 region? Bitcoin has experienced a major rally that has taken its price upwards close to 50% over the past few weeks. Even with minor retracements, the market is moving positively with higher lows each time it falls, meaning we should expect BTC to continue its climb towards $13,000 – which in my opinion might come within the next couple of weeks. Last week, I also mentioned how I’m still bullish even though I believe we’ll see 30% to 40% corrections. Prominent Bitcoin trader davincij15 has claimed all bull markets are expected to suffer large corrections of around 30-35% of the total highs in the early stages. This means we could still see Bitcoin touching its 100-day EMA or even its 200-day EMA despite the bull cycle (which can last a couple of years). Don’t forget we’ve seen similar movements during previous cycles in 2013 and 2016-2017. Nevertheless, I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal, I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Corrections are expected and welcomed so that we can accumulate even during bull seasons. $10,000 per bitcoin is absolutely justified given the current level of adoption.  The Bitcoin blockchain has remained consistently above 3.5 TPS since January (1st graph) & deals @LocalBitcoins has remained above $50 million a week since reaching this level in 2017 (2nd graph). pic.twitter.com/zHa2AgOD4A — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) June 21, 2019  Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past two weeks, volume has gone from $17 billion to $23 billion, consolidating now around $20 billion. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $15,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Of course, if you think I might be overreacting to positive news, you can always check what other expert analysts have to say about this recent price movement. Hopefully, the market will continue this positive momentum. Pay attention to retracements back down towards the 200-day EMA to make new entries. Safe trades!

1," Having recently read an article on the BBC website purporting to try and explain the importance of blockchain to the world’s economy, I was struck by the intellectual muddiness of these waters and how easy it is to confuse blockchain with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with altcoins. It really is no wonder that the “man on the street” doesn’t understand these things, and consequently these misconceptions have become a real barrier to mainstream adoption. At the heart of blockchain, it really isn’t much more than a ledger or database (dependent on which descriptor you prefer). A blockchain database is unique, however, through its three pillars of being distributed (multiple copies of), being decentralised (no one copy has version control), and immutable (each transaction recorded is unchangeable). Bitcoin was the first blockchain, and as such is frequently referred to when trying to explain or understand blockchain. What the Bitcoin protocol (the underlying rules of the blockchain) solved technically was the double spend problem. This was key to creating a digital cash that was unforgeable. It’s easy to go too far down the rabbit hole on Bitcoin and start looking at the economic programming and proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors, but this takes us away from understanding blockchain. In order to offer a simple explanation of the difference between blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it’s best to use the analogy of the internet and email. Email, it’s widely agreed, was the internet’s first killer app – so email is simply an application built on top of the internet, but the internet offers far more than just email. Similarly, Bitcoin was blockchain’s first killer app, and as such, all cryptocurrency is built on top of a blockchain – but blockchain can do so much more than just cryptocurrency. With blockchain working as a shared ledger and acting as a trusted central source of truth, we can see organisations looking to solve such complex topics as digital identity (Sovrin), supply chain digital transformation (Tradelens), food provenance (IBM Food Trust), and efficiency in the transportation and logistic industry (BITA). Under the cloak of darkness, many companies are aiming to create proof of concepts that can deliver real-world results for their various industries. In time, the cloak will be lifted and we will see which ones have succeeded and, hopefully, which ones have failed and we can learn from. The Bitcoin protocol is slow, but this is not the protocol that would be used in enterprise environments. The Bitcoin protocol is energy hungry (through PoW), but enterprise blockchains would not use PoW as its consensus mechanism. If you’re looking at having a digital form of money, it makes sense that there should be a cost to creating it in the form of energy consumption. If you’re aiming to clean up the luxury goods markets from fakes and rip-offs, a consortia of luxury goods manufacturers and retailers using proof of authority makes sense – it really is a case of horses for courses. The article also discusses the value that many intermediaries have, and this isn’t wrong. There are plenty of middlemen that actually add value to our every day lives, including the basic function of banking to be the trusted custodian of our money. However, there are also plenty of things that commercial banks do that do not add value, and we should take back sovereignty over – international transfers of money for one. Centralised third-party middlemen are not the problem, the degree to which we can trust them to act on our behalf is. The BBC article misunderstands a basic precept about Bitcoin regarding the speed of transactions by comparing it to Mastercard and Visa. A better comparison for Bitcoin is gold, where transaction in the metal takes a long time and costs a lot of money as it’s generally done as a settlement layer at central bank level. One day in the future, I, and many others believe that Bitcoin will be able to be used as simply as Mastercard or Visa is today, but that requires a layer two solution (such as Lightning), and a much more significant market cap that would be in the trillions of dollars. We may be some way from that being a reality at the present time, but that is just a reason why we should make the effort to understand these issues today. The article jumps to talking about problems with other blockchain based currencies, known as altcoins, but without creating a clear distinction from Bitcoin and creating the clarification that there is no “the blockchain”, but actually many different flavours of the same concept. Many of the altcoins, are based upon a token that drives actions on top of the matching blockchain. For example, Ethereum was a new protocol that went live in 2015 and was intended to be a decentralised global computer with the ability to execute smart contracts. Ether was the token created both as a way to raise the initial funds to build the technology and is now the gas that powers it. Ethereum also paved the way for a glut of new tokens created by entrepreneurs (and scammers) on top of the Ethereum protocol, most of which only had a utility within the application built on top of it. Many people have tried to create new cryptocurrencies, some through forks of pre-existing protocols and coins (such as Bitcoin), and some as entirely new protocols. For some of the entrepreneurs that went down this road, it was little more than a way of making themselves rich. However the main problem with the altcoins when trying to be viewed as money, is that they tend to be overly centralised (meaning that the transactions and rules of the currency won’t have as much trust), and look to reduce energy consumption and speed up transaction throughput through different consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated PoS, and tend to lack scarcity – if you understand economics, it’s fairly easy to see that without significant cost and scarcity, there can be no significant value created with respect to money. Again, look at the comparison to finding and excavating gold from the earth. My belief is that in ten years’ time, Bitcoin will have either changed the world we live in or will have become virtually valueless. Conversely, I believe that blockchain is here to stay and will change the world but needs to fade into the background. The reality is that blockchain is still mostly hype, as was the internet in 1994. The industry needs time to develop – just because it’s hype today, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t real world-changing tech there.

3," So now the old guard of the big tech companies have announced their intention to join the new world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. It was only ever a matter of time. But what does this mean for Bitcoin, and the wider blockchain space? There is a huge amount to unpack from the white paper, so I’m not able to breakdown the whole lot, but my view today is that through Libra and Facebook, the words “blockchain” and “cryptocurrency” will start to become more trusted and a more comfortable lexicon for those not currently anywhere near this space – this is a good thing overall for the industry… First let’s get clear on the distinctions between Libra and Bitcoin; Bitcoin is generally viewed as a future store of value, as today it is not a cheap, fast or effective way to send small amounts of money (until a solid layer 2 solution can be implemented at scale), but with a finite supply and a pre-programmed flow of new coins, it’s a deflationary currency – something we’ve not had for a long time. So potentially Bitcoin is good as an investment asset/product, but not really as a medium of exchange or a unit of account. Libra, on the other hand, will be pegged to a basket of government-issued currencies (and bonds?) and will be relatively stable in value, by comparison, meaning that it is still impacted by inflationary pressures inherent to those currencies. Although purists won’t view Libra as either blockchain or a real cryptocurrency, it definitely has aspects of both. Libra should be viewed as digital money, easily purchased and transacted with, but not a very good store of value (SoV) unless you are in a country suffering from hyperinflation. Libra will benefit from being accessible through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and their two billion daily active users. Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp will drive consumer adoption of Libra and when enough consumers have Libra, merchants will follow. Facebook will create both sides of the ecosystem through its sheer size. With a large base of consumers and merchants as its engine, Libra can deliver frictionless payments to friends, family and businesses across (almost) all borders at speed with no transaction costs. Facebook has managed to bring in some of the biggest brands and companies into the Libra foundation including Visa, Mastercard, Uber and PayPal as well as some big players in the venture capital space. Each member of the foundation pays $10million. The money is used to support the underlying basis for the Libra coin value. Additionally, members of the foundation run the computers (nodes) of the Libra blockchain creating the basis for distributed ledger and decentralised control. This raises questions – and eyebrows – about what those companies might then do with the sensitive financial data they may now be privy to? Facebook has already had to weather the storm of negative press and congressional hearings around how they use data, and whether the public will trust them not to utilise that data for ad targeting – they’ve said they won’t, but the key word is “trust”. No doubt, Libra’s biggest obstacle to success will be governments around the world, their central banks, and the regulators who want to ensure consumers are protected, and no unfair advantages are given to any entities. It was only a few weeks ago that we saw the SEC move on Kik and their token Kin. Kik promotes the Kin token as a utility, whilst the SEC put forward their interpretation that the Kin token is a security. They believe the Kin token was purchased with a view that investors could hold and make a profit. Unsurprisingly, Kik have come out fighting (they didn’t have much choice though really). If the value of the Libra coin is to be based on the value of a basket of currencies, bonds and other assets, then its value will not be pegged to any single currency. This makes Libra a new unit of account when adoption and utility reach a critical mass. I really can’t see the Federal Reserve rolling over and allowing a new sovereign currency to suck value away from the dollar – effectively the global reserve currency. Suddenly, many of the cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists will be rooting for a multi-billion dollar corporate behemoth and its corporate buddies. As the saying goes, “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” – right? It definitely looks that way today. Libra will have a net positive effect on Bitcoin and the wider Blockchain space, just through the massive PR machine that is Facebook. Facebook has not snatched at this play. They’ve put smart people on it, taken their time, and really considered how best to execute. Facebook knows how to execute, and they’ve seemingly done it every time (from newsfeed updates to smart acquisitions), and the one thing you know they’ll get right is a smooth user experience that your grandma can use – do not underestimate just how important this is. Libra can only be a good thing for awareness. With Libra, Joe Public can start learning “what’s this Bitcoin thing is all about?”. Libra will also make corporates start to consider the role of consortia and decentralisation through utilising blockchain, and what issues that may solve for their respective industries. Ultimately, only time will tell as to how successful Libra coin will be for all parties involved, but right now, I wouldn’t bet against Libra’s success. And I hope that in turn, this will drive greater understanding of Bitcoin, and society’s need for sound money.

," One of Bitcoin’s most valuable features is timelocks. The feature, which has existed since the first release of Bitcoin, enables users to create transactions that are invalid (unspendable) until a certain amount of time has passed. In 2015 and 2016, a handful of Bitcoin Core developers introduced more advanced levels of timelocks, enabling users to create timelocks for individual Bitcoin outputs rather than entire transactions. Timelocks also provide the base and infrastructure for a variety of smart contracts and projects built on Bitcoin. Layer two projects like Lightning Network rely heavily on the development of Bitcoin’s timelock features. Companies like Particl also use timelock features to create escrow services for clients.

Latest Bitcoin price and analysis (BTC to USD)," Following Bitcoin’s momentary breach of $9,000 last week, the market quickly reversed and price fell almost $1,000 to a low of just over $8,000. Since then, the market found support above $8,400 to trade up to a weekend high of $8,800. Since that local high, Bitcoin again started to sell off over the last 12 hours to retest and find support again around the $8,400 level. This level is historically key as the 2017 support found here helped propel Bitcoin’s parabolic rise up to an eventual high of $20,000. If price can find support following this morning’s fall, then it looks like it may be consolidating inside a potential rising wedge formation. At the time of writing, it looks like we may see some more short-term consolidation inside this formation. Any break outside the upper or lower bounds would most likely cause Bitcoin to either fall back down to around the $6,800 support level or – if we see a bull market continuation – rise back up to a five-figure valuation for the world’s most decentralised digital asset.

On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are. The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without “relying on trust”. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number “0” (or the “genesis block”), which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins.

1," Legal questions hang over Poloniex, the cryptocurrency exchange, after a price crash in a little known alt coin forced the firm to liquidate the positions of traders on the platform. What happened On May 26, altcoin $CLAM collapsed more than two thirds of its value during the day, resulting in the margin lending pool incurring a more than $13 million USD loss in today's price of bitcoin. Now, Poloniex is tapping into 1,800 BTC from the principal of active BTC margin loans to cover the loss to the lending pool. In margin trading, exchanges and traders can lend crypto at an interest rate for borrowers to trade, hopefully at a gain. Users have to pay back what they are lent. When a borrower is unable to pay back the loan, they default, losing money they didn’t have to begin with. Some trading CLAM, a coin with low liquidity, began to default on their loans as the value of the coin dropped, making them unable to pay since their assets were now worth far less than when they borrowed. Worse, many of those who defaulted had used CLAM for collateral on the loans, the amount put up to safeguard against an extreme loss for the lender, like a deposit. Since the coin had reached such a low value, that collateral became nearly worthless as well. While Poloniex said it is uncommon for traders to use CLAM as collateral, non U.S. traders can do so with any asset available for lending. The number of defaults left the lending pool with 1,800 BTC unrepaid by borrowers. To mitigate the loss, Poloniex “socialized” it among BTC margin traders. The exchange took 16.202% from the principal of all currently active BTC loans even those that weren’t active at the time of the crash. While only affecting 0.4% of Poloniex users, this still incurred the ire of some BTC margin traders. But more than that, it raised questions about how losses can be sustained by crypto exchanges. Can they do that? Poloniex said it spread the loss among BTC lenders because the exchange pools loan on margin to mitigate risk.  ""Because all BTC loans on Poloniex are lent in a common pool that is shared across all markets and borrowers, but we want to emphasize that we are pursuing defaulted borrowers to get them to repay the BTC they owe to lenders and exploring other ways to defray losses,"" said a company spokesperson. ""As we recover funds, we will return them to affected lenders."" The legality of the practice was questioned by sources, including Silver, but it's unclear what that means for the crypto economy since there hasn’t been a public case interpreting the problem. That could change if Poloniex’s U.S. based BTC lenders decide to take legal action, and legal sources say they probably will. “Any crypto exchange that socializes losses is begging for a lawsuit,” said David Silver, an attorney specializing in securities law. A former crypto exchange executive said it depends on how one defines ""legal,"" since lending is state-regulated unless you have a federal license. To be clear, the firm said it only offers margin lending and borrowing to non-US customers. The firm said it is “exploring other ways to help defray margin lender losses, and, as we recover funds, will return them to affected lenders."" The Block did not find a clear term in Poloniex’s terms of service indicating a precedent for socializing a loss, and Poloniex did not directly respond to the question in an email interview, but said the 16% figure was proportional to the amount of losses in the lending pool. Regardless, Silver said it would be unlikely for a court to allow an exchange to socialize a loss even with a term of service stated. “I highly doubt any court would allow that to stand,” he said. Stephen Palley, another attorney with Anderson Kill, disagreed with Silver, saying he didn't necessarily think Poloniex breached their terms of service.  ""Now maybe you could blame them for listing an asset with a thin order-book like clam,"" he said. Still, one anonymous source in capital markets consulting, told The Block Poloniex should have had more controls in place to monitor the liquidity of the asset, giving warning calls to traders if necessary. ""If there was a liquidity squeeze on this type of asset they should have had better risk management controls,"" said the source. Other steps taken In response to the crash, Poloniex did more than give its BTC lending pool a haircut. All defaulted accounts have been frozen until the loans are repaid. ""Margin lending and borrowing are only available to non-US customers, we are pursuing the defaulted borrowers to get them to repay the BTC they owe to lenders,"" said a company spokesperson. It removed BTS, CLAM, FCT and MAID citing a lack of liquidity in these markets. A liquidity problem led to the CLAM crash, since traders couldn’t liquidate their positions fast enough to get out from under the falling value. Poloniex said it would continue to monitor the coins and could reinstate them in the future. The exchange has also added additional layers to monitor markets so it can disable problematic assets. It also plans to add more market protections to prevent price slippage and over-concentration, including the NICE/Actimize tool which was implemented on June 1. Update: This post has been edited to attribute claims of the legality of Poloniex’s actions to Silver and other sources. We also added commentary from Stephen Palley, an attorney with Anderson Kill. ",Aislinn Keely,The Block,2019-06-07T17:38:59.000Z
18," The yield curve has inverted and investors are concerned about the threats of tariffs amid the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China and the overall slowdown of the global economy. But amid all the turmoil, gold remains a safe haven and it also is still a go-to investment over increasingly popular cryptocurrencies. “I’m not seeing any flood of money out of gold into cryptos, and if there were, I don’t think the cryptocurrencies would have lost 80% of their value last year,” George Milling-Stanley, State Street Global Advisors’ head of Gold Strategy, told Yahoo Finance On the Move, adding that is what he is hearing from a lot of financial advisors. “They all seem to have a question about cryptocurrencies because their investors, at whatever demographic, are asking them whether this is a good idea,” he said. Gold has so far lived up to its safe haven status, according to Milling-Stanley, because it maintains its value “when your stocks and bonds in your portfolio are going down.” “Gold has managed to maintain its level rather than falling [because of] this general atmosphere of uncertainty that makes people look for safe havens,” he said. “We haven’t seen the collapse in the stock market, that would obviously be helpful for gold prices. The yield curve is giving mixed signals, there seems to be confusion to whether it’s signaling recession or not.” Gold prices tend to go up when the stock and bond market go down. To Milling-Stanley “that’s just gravy. What you’re really looking for is something that preserves wealth rather than necessarily creates it.” He predicts that we will see more volatility in the dollar and especially in the stock market, noting that the fact that stocks have gone up these past nine years has him wary because it’s not expected to continue. “I’m not saying stocks are going to fall off a cliff, but we’re looking for a lot more volatility this year, and I think that’s in line with most economic views,” he said. “Gold tends to do well when everything else is more volatile.” When it comes to recession fears, Milling-Stanley argues there isn’t a “strong signal” for worry. In making his argument for gold, beyond just a safe-haven asset, Milling-Stanley said its a good long-term investment. “Over the long-term, gold does give you a reasonable rate of return. Over the last 50 years, for example, gold on a compound annual growth-rate basis has returned 7.5% a year. That’s not too bad at all for an asset that doesn’t have a yield or a coupon.” When deciding just how much to allocate, Milling-Stanley would recommend 5%. He told Yahoo Finance, “between 2% and10% would make sense as a strategic allocation. If you think we’re about to go into a period of extreme turbulence in markets, a view I happen to hold, then it can make sense to double those allocations.” All in all, “somewhere between 2% and 20% — personally, I like 5% as a strategic allocation,” he said.

Cryptocurrency market update: Bitcoin continues to rise," At the time of writing, the positive momentum in the cryptocurrency markets is still present. Bitcoin is well on the way to $10,000, and that means we can expect some altcoins to pump higher as well. Bitcoin has broken past the $6,000, $7,000, and $8,000 levels with ease. Since then, we touched the $9,000 level for a brief moment before returning to the $8,500 area soon after. However, over this past weekend, BTC was able to break the $9,000 level again and remain above it, finding support near $9,100. We can’t forget Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset that is helping investors dodge economic and geopolitical risks in the form of trade wars, sluggish GDP growth, and what appears to be a new era of quantitative easing for central banks. For that reason, the coin has emerged as the top-performing asset of 2019, vastly outperforming stocks, bonds, commodities, and government-backed currencies. Plus, Bitcoin’s all-time ROI is now over 6,000%. Let’s take a look at how the top cryptocurrencies have been performing. Bitcoin experienced a major rally that took its price upwards close to 18% over the weekend. Afterwards, price pulled back closer to its new support level at around $9,100. At the moment, the market is moving upwards with higher lows each time it falls, meaning we should expect BTC to continue its climb towards $10,000 – which in my opinion might come within the next couple of weeks before the end of the month. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal – not only in shorter time-frames but also in daily and weekly ones as well – I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past seven days, volume went from $17 billion to $23 billion, retracing today to the $20 billion region. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $10,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Looking at the Ethereum chart above, we can clearly see a couple of interesting features. Firstly, the 20-day EMA has crossed the 50-day EMA, and the latter has crossed the 200-day EMA, which are both quite bullish signals. Price is now also trading well above the 200-day EMA at over $270. Moreover, there could now be new support forming around $220, just above the 200-day EMA. The newly achieved yearly highs for Ethereum have been brought about thanks to the massive boost in Bitcoin recently. For the time being, I expect ETH to maintain its positive momentum, as I don’t see a reason for the trend to break. Volume-wise, ETH has been growing steadily. It went from about $7 billion last week to over $9 billion today – a sign of a healthy bull market. Ripple (XRP) has had a pretty bullish period as of late. Just look at the chart above. In mid-May 2019, price skyrocketed from about $0.294 to $0.47 – representing a 40% rise. It then crashed back to close to its 200-day EMA, around $0.37, before recovering back to above $0.42, where it sits now. Not only that, but the price of XRP managed to cross the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs as volumes went berserk. I expect support to be around $0.43 and then again at $0.38, where the 200-day EMA is sitting. If the 50-day EMA crosses or touches the 200-day EMA during June, we should expect XRP to go past $0.50. If volumes stay on the side of buyers, which seems to be likely, I’m expecting some altcoins like XRP to start picking up speed towards higher target levels. LTC has gained close to 7% since last week, which is quite an amazing achievement from a coin that was trading around $30 in January 2019 and peaked at $100 in April. Fundamentals remain strong as LTC’s adoption keeps rising due to small fees and faster block times. Plus, the halvening event is just around the corner, and this usually has a tendency to push prices upwards. At the moment, price is trading above $135, and I expect it to continue to rise towards the $150 and $170 levels, where it should find resistance. If you were one of the smart ones who bought-in during the early 2019 dip, congratulations! LTC has been the best performing coin in 2019, growing from about $30 to $135 in just a few months. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently sitting above $435 – almost 11% higher than last week – following my prediction that BCH would break the $400 level. Bitcoin is still gaining market-share dominance over most coins, including BCH, and BCH price is currently trading at its lowest against BTC since late 2018. However, this doesn’t mean investors won’t take this opportunity to convert BTC into BCH. Bitcoin Cash has broken the major $350 level around its 20-day EMA, and the 50-day EMA is getting close to the 200-day EMA. Moreover, the trend seems to be quite bullish, even though volumes have shrunk over the past week. If order books stay on the side of buyers, which will become increasingly difficult the more price goes up, we could see BCH climbing again to $500 and above in just a few days. Last week, I wrote my expectation was for Bitcoin to moon to $10,000 soon. It certainly seems like we’re going in that direction now. A smart move is to make small entries both when price corrects around target support levels and if price moves upwards towards resistance levels. Safe trades!

Falling short of the first major resistance level at $0.4425, Ripple’s XRP slid to a late intraday low $0.42117. The reversal saw Ripple’s XRP fall through the first major support level at $0.42760 before a late move back through to $0.43 levels. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 2.56% to $0.44250. A particularly bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rally from a morning low $0.43133 to a high $0.44609. Ripple’s XRP broke through the first major resistance level at $0.4400 to come within range of the second major resistance level at $0.4473. For the day ahead, a hold above $0.4380 levels through the morning would support a run at the second major resistance level at $0.4473. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $0.44609. In the event of an extended crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP could strike $0.45 levels before any pullback. Failure to hold above $0.4380 levels could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse. A fall through to sub-$0.4310 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.4234 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ripple’s XRP would likely steer clear of sub-$0.42 levels on the day.

"Facebook scam targets UAE residents, claims endorsement from Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince"," A Facebook scam has been targeting United Arab Emirates residents, The National writes. Scammers used the image of Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince, claiming he endorses the Bitcoin projects and is helping people make profits. According to the report, the scam was disseminated on Facebook via a sponsored post, which has been shared thousands of times and has generated even more comments. However, at the moment, it is not certain how many people were tricked into sending their money. Fraudsters promised that the scheme, which cost AED 1,000 (approximately $270), would make people “rich in seven days.” The sponsored post included a fake quote from the Crown Prince, claiming the scheme was his “way of giving back to the people.” The post linked to a fake news story that mixed facts with fabrications; it included a fake quote from Bill Gates and as well as a fictitious tweet from Sheikh Mohamed. The story itself was penned by a nonexistent journalist Michael Alvarado, and used a picture of a U.S.-based freelance journalist Timothy Seppala, who had been unaware his picture was used for a scam. Since the scam has been unearthed, the Facebook page used for the scam has been deleted.  The Abu Dhabi Media Office has urged people to “check the authenticity of campaigns asking for pledges or donations in case of fraud, particularly online and on social media.”",Carol Gaszcz,The Block,2019-07-01T19:51:26.000Z
Why Voice is much more than just another crypto social network," Voice. Everyone should have one. That is the premise behind a new blockchain-based social network recently announced by Block.one – the company that created the source code for EOS and continues to develop it. In a bold statement at the company’s June 1 event at the DC Armory in Washington, DC, the CEO of Block.one – Brendan Bloomer – said that the major social networks of today are designed to use their users. They use our data and our attention to make money primarily through advertising. Voice, a new social network, is designed to correct this by bringing power and control back to the individual user, using blockchain technology of course. The problem many – if not all – crypto projects have is that they do not exist in isolation. There are many other components that their success relies on that they don’t have the resources to build themselves. Therefore, whenever something new is introduced, there is a lot of “yeah, but”, because the scope of any given project has to stop somewhere. The Voice social network may be the thing that everyone is focusing on, but there were a number of other elements to the announcement that dealt with many of the prerequisites to making such a project successful. In order to use a blockchain-based app like Voice, users need to create an account on the underlying blockchain platform. This costs money and is complex, so Block.one decided to offer free EOS accounts to remove the friction of getting started using Voice. In order to perform transactions on an EOS app like Voice, each user needs to hold tokens and be allocated network resources. In a two-in-one announcement at the recent event, Coinbase spoke about the ability to earn free EOS tokens by going through a set of short educational video lessons the company has created at https://www.coinbase.com/earn/eos. This not only helps new users get to grips with the EOS network, they also get rewarded with free tokens and thus an allocation of network resources that enable them to do transactions. Crypto tokens and accounts use public and private keys. These are complex to manage, store, and secure. The average social network user will find this far too much to grasp. On to the stage at the June 1 event came a representative from Yubico, a company that makes and develops the Yubikey – a device that acts much like a physical key except for the digital world. If you possess the metal key to your house, you simply turn it in the lock and get access. It’s so simple that anyone and everyone can do it, including children. Now let’s say we mirror that in the digital world. Instead of usernames and passwords (which we don’t need to unlock the front door to our house), we have a Yubikey on our key ring right next to all our metal keys. When we want to log in to an online service like the Voice social network, we simply insert our digital key into the lock (USB port) and go straight in. This is so close to the experience and ease of unlocking locks in the physical world as to have almost no learning curve. For a number of years, Dan Larimer, the CTO of Block.one, has said that decentralised alternatives will not succeed if they are only as good as their centralised equivalents – they need to be superior. Passwordless access to your social media account qualifies as a superior user experience in my book. Blockchain-based social networks are far too slow for the average user to bother with. Another announcement that was made at the June event was EOSIO 2, a much-upgraded version of the software that underpins EOS-based blockchains. The most significant update the team focused on was performance. EOSIO 2 can apparently run code 12 times faster than the original code Block.one released. Performance is obviously a crucial feature given the speed at which people interact on social networks. If the network is slow, users will not put up with it for long. I am a big fan of the existing blockchain social network Steem. Also created by Dan Larimer, this network distributes newly-created cryptocurrency based on the popularity of content that is posted rather than the pure hardware-based mining that Bitcoin uses. Young people especially have no loyalty to their social networks. They will switch to whatever is hot and trending. I am confident that if Voice proves to be superior even to Steem, then the offer of a new social network that pays you (with the Voice token) to post will be an offer that the youth can’t refuse. Especially when they find out they can spend their tokens to amplify the visibility of their posts and gather more attention. Once young people have validated the platform, they will begin to drag everyone else with them. The difference this time is that they may well stick because as they post, they earn tokens, which act like a share in the platform itself. It’s the sense of ownership that I think is missing from the centralised social networks that causes the disloyalty. That and a distrust of the big, centralised networks. Since trust is not even a consideration for an open public blockchain that runs on open source software, we have a bag of incentives that may well have an appeal far beyond the younger generation. But there is an even bigger source of certainty with Voice – identity. Facebook has a problem with fake accounts. There is an incentive for underground marketing agencies to create millions of fake accounts and use them to begin contacting and promoting all manner of products and services. In fact, Facebook recently revealed that it had closed 2.2 billion fake accounts. The plan with Voice is to use a special authentication system to ensure no individual human creates more than one account. This includes only storing the digital fingerprint of the person on the blockchain instead of all their personal identity data. This ensures compliance with privacy regulations like GDPR. Once you have a social media account you can log in to with a private key that is tied to a unique human individual, opportunities to do some unimaginable stuff open up. A couple of big ones I am thinking of are incorruptible political voting and even universal basic income.

8," At the time of writing, the positive momentum in the crypto markets is still present. Much like the two previous weekends, the entire market has consolidated nicely, despite a bumpy start to Monday. Bitcoin has broken past the $6,000, $7,000, and $8,000 levels with ease. Since then, we touched the $9,000 level for a brief moment, before returning to the $8,500 area soon after. As I mentioned last week, the pump could be linked to the Consensus conference that took place in NY last month, as we’ve seen similar movements prior to this crypto conference in previous years. Also, as we saw during most talks and speeches, loads of crypto enthusiasts clearly see BTC as a store of value. Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset that is helping investors dodge economic and geopolitical risks in the form of trade wars, sluggish GDP growth, and what appears to be a new era of quantitative easing for central banks. For that reason, the coin has emerged as the top-performing asset of 2019, vastly outperforming stocks, bonds, commodities, and government-backed currencies. Let’s take a look at how the top cryptocurrencies performed during the weekend. Bitcoin’s rally went parabolic last weekend, and the momentum lasted throughout most of the week before a 12% dive on Thursday. Bitcoin was sitting at around $8,700 on Sunday before a drop down to $8,500 on Monday morning. The overall momentum seems to be quite positive, although there are some fears price is overbought. Nevertheless, I tend to avoid countering trends, as it’s usually riskier than just going with the flow. If prices are roaring, you probably shouldn’t try to short them. Don’t forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. By looking at the chart above, we’re clearly in a bull run. Not only that, we’ve touched a critical level around $9,000, which could be an indicator the market is looking to continue pushing forward. Looking at the Ethereum chart above, we can clearly see a couple of interesting features. Firstly, the 20-day EMA has crossed the 50-day EMA, which is a very bullish signal. Price is now also trading well above the 200-day EMA. Moreover, there could now be new support forming around $195, just above the 200-day EMA. The newly achieved yearly highs for Ethereum have been brought about thanks to the massive boost in Bitcoin last month. Nonetheless, the 50-day EMA hasn’t crossed the 200-day EMA yet, meaning there is still room for short-term gains. For the time being, I expect ETH to maintain its positive momentum, as I don’t see a reason for the trend to break. Even with lower volumes, price has been consolidating above $250. If Ether maintains its movement upwards, the next target level is around $260, while resistance-wise, it seems we’re getting closer to the $280 and $300 levels. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently sitting above $430 – almost 10% higher than last week – following my prediction that BCH would break the $400 level. Bitcoin is still gaining market-share dominance over most coins, including BCH, and BCH price is currently trading at its lowest against BTC since late 2018. However, this doesn’t mean investors won’t take this opportunity to convert BTC into BCH. Bitcoin Cash has broken the major $350 level around its 20-day EMA, and the 50-day EMA is getting close to the 200-day EMA. Moreover, the trend seems to be quite bullish, even though volumes have shrunk during last week and the weekend. What I expect to happen is altcoins such as BCH, ETH, XRP, and LTC will rise both against BTC (even though prices may drop) and USD. If order books stay on the side of buyers, which will become increasingly difficult the more price goes up, we could see BCH climbing again to $500 and above in just a few days. Ripple (XRP) has had a pretty bullish period as of late. Just look at the chart above. In the space of just a few days, price skyrocketed from about $0.294 to $0.47 – representing a 40% rise. It did crash back to close to its 200-day EMA, around $0.37, before recovering back to above $0.43. Not only that, but XRP managed to cross the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs as volumes went berserk. I expect support to be around $0.43 and then again at $0.38. If the 50-day EMA crosses or touches the 200-day EMA during the week, we should expect XRP to moon past $0.5. Still, volumes are thinner, and that could mean consolidation for a while. Although Litecoin has been underperforming compared to other altcoins during the past two weeks, we shouldn’t forget LTC has been on a bull run since February – and it hasn’t stopped yet. From last week, LTC has gained close to 11%, which is a quite amazing achievement from a coin that was trading around $30 in January 2019 and peaked at $100 in April. Fundamentals remain strong as LTC’s adoption keeps rising due to small fees and faster block times. At the moment, price is trading well above $110, and I expect it to continue to rise towards the $120 level. On the downside, we could see price moving towards the $104 and $99 levels. Last week I wrote my expectation was for price to correct. It didn’t. A smart move is to make small entries both when price corrects around target support levels and if price moves upwards towards resistance levels. Safe trades!

Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto," In a recent interview on London Real, the Bitcoin and open blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos talked about the wrong type of people entering the digital asset economy, and why many end up staying for different reasons other than price. On the topic of the many hype-based cryptocurrency projects we see today, Antonopoulos said that the industry sometimes attracts the wrong type of crowd into the ecosystem. “It attracts scammers, opportunists, pump and dumpers, and pyramid schemes, and the ICO market enabled a lot of those people to make their own coins.” Andreas said that one of the reasons the ICO craze happened was because Ethereum made it easy for people to build a scalable, secure, transferable, and censorship-resistant blockchain “just by writing 20 lines of code”. But the Mastering Ethereum author said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains “to build platforms to do massive pump and dumps” instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance. However, he did mention that in the long run, “if you can fund start-ups with an international pool of investors, that can change the investment fields”. FOMO is in the air. Newbies are joining the cryptocurrency space and falling prey to scammers.  Please educate your friends and family:– Promises of profit are 100% ponzi– Request to ""recruit"", ""affiliate"" etc are 100% pyramid schemes– ICO/IEO are 99.99% pump-and-dump — Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) June 20, 2019  Regarding the parabolic rises and falls of many crypto assets, Andreas said that “nothing goes exponential without going down”, and that Bitcoin has done this eight times already as “that’s how it grows”. “The reason it grows like this is that there isn’t much in terms of short pressure to hold it down,” he said. “If you’ve got something that has limited supply and you suddenly have a speculative mania that blows up, it will continue to go up in a straight line, which only further fuels the mania. “Until it reaches a point where there simply isn’t anybody else who feels just as enthusiastic and it pauses for a second, the panic just drives [the price] down.” Andreas said that there’s “no difference between speculators and investors” and that they’re just speculating with a different risk profile, with some of them doing so “with very little research and information”. He said that the reason this is bad is that “a lot of good, innocent, and slightly naive people lost a lot of money” and had their lives destroyed because of this. This has a negative effect “as it changes the community” and “causes damage to the community”. “You have a lot of drama that comes up when there’s money on the table – people’s personalities change.” He said that people start taking shortcuts and their ethics become compromised – “power corrupts, money corrupts”. Andreas said that the majority of people first got involved in crypto most likely “because they heard that it’s some kind of investment opportunity”. He made the case that even though many of these people may have first entered the space “because of speculation and mania”, the people who were only motivated by price left during the 2018 crash, with those who stayed “finding other motivations”. He claimed some of the reasons why people stay is because they like the community, they understand the technology, and they may even be “driven by the political implications”. To those people, Andreas said: “Welcome, you may have come because you want to get rich – that’s okay. Now let me tell you about why you should stay because of the technology even after the price crashes.”   The post Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Nawaz Sulemanji,Coin Rivet,2019-07-03T13:00:11.000Z

A former US Government senior official has ripped into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, warning they could all suddenly be worth nothing. John Reed Stark, who served for more than two decades with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – half of it as head of its Office for Internet Enforcement – used his latest swipe at BTC to carry a foreboding message that crypto will, without warning, have a value of zero. In a Coin Rivet article for the Daily Express, the former government finance supremo lays into the whole concept of cryptocurrency in a bile-addled tirade. Stark, who has repeatedly railed against crypto since leaving office, regularly writes articles and essays on why he sides with entrepreneur Warren Buffett in a shared dislike of currencies they both label as “akin to rat poison”. But in his latest article, for Law360, crypto naysayer Stark vents his most furious views yet as he brands initial exchange offerings (IEOs) as “predators” before promising the SEC would soon be clamping down on the “unregulated crypto-casino fundraising mutations”. “They are an enticing medium for fraud, manipulation, insider trading, hacking, and a broad range of chicanery,” he slammed. “IEOs represent yet another blatant attempt to hijack a similar-sounding acronym — IPO — in an effort to lure investors seeking to get rich quick. However, just like ICOs, the IEO has not a single element in common with the IPO (other than the first and last letters of its acronym).” The bulk of his ire, though, is reserved for Bitcoin itself, which he belittles as having no real-world use case other than assisting criminals. “Much of Bitcoin’s value, outside of mere speculation, is derived solely from its ability to facilitate criminal activity,” he argues. “Need a fake ID, bottle of opiates, a cache of credit card numbers, or a thousand Social Security numbers? Need a way to collect a ransomware payment? Need to fund terrorist-related activities? Need to hire a hitman? “Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have become the payment of choice for these, and a slew of other, criminal enterprises.” His closing remarks, however, will send a chill down the spine of would-be crypto investors. “People are going to wake up one day and not find that the value of their BTC investment is diminishing, but that it is zero,” he warns. “One moment you will be looking at $8,000 per coin, the next, global trading will be suspended. The true market of BTC is zero. When it’s stopped, it will just end. “As soon as a system of such kind starts to move outside of the legal constructions that allow it to operate, it stands on a foundation of watered sand and will eventually collapse. “When it collapses, it can never be recovered.”   Have you noticed that Coin Rivet has China covered?

CFTC trading data shows many are shorting CME bitcoin futures," Despite the recent bitcoin price spike, big traders are bearish, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The outlet reported data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showing managers holding 14% more short positions in CME bitcoin futures last week than long positions. Other firms, neither money managers nor small investors, also held three times as many short positions, according to the report. Futures allow traders to bet on the rise and fall of an asset, so the increase of short positions indicates an overall bearish attitude by big players. However, bitcoin has risen above $11,000, indicating there is some optimism. The CFTC report showed small investors held more long positions. The demographic of investors with fewer than 25 BTC contracts showed four times as many long positions. That report was released Friday, with data reflecting when bitcoin was hovering around $9,000. ",Aislinn Keely,The Block,2019-06-25T23:11:32.000Z

"Bitwise, Amun launch a new crypto ETP on Swiss stock exchange"," Cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise and Swiss fintech company Amun AG have launched a new exchange-traded product (ETP) on Switzerland’s top stock exchange SIX, and it promises to offer diversified liquid exposure to the nascent digital market.   Bitwise has licensed “The Bitwise 10 Select Large Cap Crypto Index” to Amun AG, which will be used as the benchmark index for the new ETP product - “Amun Bitwise Select 10 Large Cap Crypto Index ETP” with the ticker symbol KEYS.   Notably, the ETP will not be available to U.S. customers, according to the statement from Bitwise.  Bitwise said that the index will track the performance of up to 10 of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world, as measured and weighted by free-float and inflation-adjusted market capitalization. Currently, the index comprises of eight cryptocurrencies - bitcoin (weight: 67.80%), ether (11.50%), XRP (8.33%), bitcoin cash (3.52%), litecoin (3.47%), EOS (3.36%) Stellar lumens (1.10%) and Cardano (0.90%), per the statements.  The index will provide non-U.S. investors “diversified exposure” to the crypto markets, said Matt Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise Asset Management. The index will be rebalanced and reconstituted every month. Hougan said it is designed for Swiss investors who want to “gain and maintain exposure to the most important crypto projects in the world.”  Bitwise built the ETP using Amun's Onyx issuance and administration platform, Hany Rashwan, CEO of Amun, told The Block, adding that “we have 2-3 additional customers that will use the platform by Fall to list their own products. After that point, we will open this platform up much more broadly.” Amun AG already manages four crypto ETPs, which are also listed on the SIX exchange - Crypto Basket Index ETP (HODL), Bitcoin ETP (ABTC), Ethereum ETP ((AETH) and the recently launched Amun XRP ETP (AXRP).  All the four ETPs are “heavily traded,” Amun AG said in the statement, adding that the HODL ETP is the “most traded USD-denominated ETP on SIX since inception on Nov. 21, 2018, in terms of trading volume.” “Of all the existing crypto products currently listed globally, the Amun Bitwise Select 10 ETP is uniquely the most diversified listed crypto product,” said Rashwan.",Yogita Khatri,The Block,2019-06-26T14:49:20.000Z
Monero Technical Analysis – Resistance Levels in Play – 21/06/19," How to Buy Monero’s XMR Monero’s XMR rallied by 4.61% on Thursday.  Following on from a 3.95% gain from Wednesday, Monero’s XMR ended the day at $105.24. A bullish morning saw Monero’s XMR rally from an early intraday low $100.16 to a late morning high $107.0. Steering clear of the major support levels, Monero’s XMR broke through the first major resistance level at $103.12 and second major resistance level at $105.90. A late morning pullback saw Monero’s XMR fall back to $100 levels before rallying to a late intraday high $108.99. Monero’s XMR managed to break back through the first and second major resistance levels before easing back through the second major resistance level. Of greater significance on the day was a hold above the 23.6% FIB of $99. For Monero’s XMR, the extended bearish trend formed at late April 2018’s swing hi $298 remained intact. Monero’s XMR continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $137, following 15th December’s swing lo $37.18. For the bulls, this week’s breakthrough to $100 levels continues to support a run at $140 levels. A move through the 38.2% FIB would see Monero’s XMR form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Monero’s XMR was up by 2.61% to $107.99. A particularly bullish start to the day saw Monero’s XMR rally from a morning low $105.3 to a high $108.41. In spite of the early breakout, Monero’s XMR came up short of the first major resistance level at $109.43. A move back through the morning high $108.41 would give Monero’s XMR another run at $109 levels later in the day. Monero’s XMR would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $109.43. In the event of a broad-based rally, Monero’s XMR could strike $110 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the morning high $108.41 could see Monero’s XMR cough up some of the morning gains. A fall through $104.80 levels would bring the first major support level at $100.60 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Monero’s XMR would likely steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $99 on the day. Major Support Level: $100.60 Major Resistance Level: $109.43 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $99 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $137 62% FIB Retracement Level: $198 Please let us know what you think in the comments below.

"Skeptic’s lens: Volatility is a feature, not a bug?"," Apart from being a censorship-resistant store of value, Bitcoin’s main use case is trading. What most people, including the media, don’t understand is that’s not inherently a bad thing.  Bitcoin’s economic activity continues to be dominated by trading on exchanges. Why? Because as opposed to the traditional finance, the cryptocurrency markets never close, they are lightly regulated and volatile. Moreover, the prices are often not driven by fundamentals, which makes it an attractive target for day-traders who analyze, buy, and sell demand on the book alongside technical analysis. High volatility levels have not only attracted day-traders but also motivated a number of high-frequency trading firms to enter the cryptocurrency market.

6," US-based crypto venture DigitalMint has teamed with convenience store chain, Circle K, installing 20 Bitcoin ATMs across Arizona and Nevada as part of a pilot programme. “We are thrilled to be partnering with a respected organisation like Circle K,” says Marc Grens, President and Co-Founder, DigitalMint. “This opens the door for massive expansion of Bitcoin access to new markets around the globe.” Customers can buy up to $20,000 in Bitcoin per day. DigitalMint charges 12% of a transaction, although rate reductions are available. The Arizona ATMs are located in Phoenix, Mesa, Tempe, Tucson, Flagstaff, Surprise, Maricopa and Nevada ATMs in Las Vegas. DigitalMint says that the partnership makes it the largest Bitcoin ATM and PoS operator in the US. It currently has over 250 locations in 25 states. Joel Konicke, Category Manager, Circle K Stores, comments: “Partnering with DigitalMint allows us to provide our customers with seamless access to Bitcoin, at a very reasonable price.” The first Bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver during 2013. But now the Mayor of the Canadian city is now proposing a ban on the machines, arguing that they open the door to money laundering. It’s important to remember who exactly is using them; some of these people are often on society’s fringes, especially sex workers. Vancouver’s potential ban on such machines will affect that vulnerable group disproportionately, argues Ethan Lou, a former journalist who these days runs a mining company in Canada and whose first book, Once a Bitcoin Miner, will be published next year. In an article for The Globe and Mail, he says: “Make no mistake, the issue of Bitcoin ATMs is one of social class. Sex workers use cryptocurrency to buy ads or run websites because credit card issuers often refuse to work with the platforms and hosting services that cater to their industry. Using cryptocurrency also grants a certain anonymity, which is of particular importance; many sex workers deliberately avoid using online exchange platforms, which have lower fees, but often require bank accounts, credit cards, a fixed address or other identification.” What makes the ATMs attractive to sex workers is also attractive to money launderers, Lou concedes. “British Columbia has wide-ranging issues with dirty money and it is not a stretch to say the ATMs could be involved. But cleaning ill-gotten gains is almost as old as sex work. Are Bitcoin ATMs used more so than, or even as frequently as, restaurants, casinos, convenience stores or any other business?” Ultimately, those who launder money might end up little affected, he argues. With the right will and means, it is not hard to buy Bitcoin anonymously for cheaper than through ATMs. “As the City of Vancouver goes about its research, it is incumbent upon staff to at least consult the sex workers who, through no fault of their own, are caught in someone else’s fight, potentially made to suffer from someone else’s sins,” Lou concludes.

When is Bitcoin FOMO going to kick in?," Bitcoin has made a 130% gain so far this year. The stock markets are down amidst the US-China trade war, which usually spurs investors toward safe-haven assets. But people aren’t buying gold. Institutions are leaping on the blockchain bandwagon one after another, with Bitcoin trading at a massive 37% premium on Grayscale. Facebook is also entering the space, as are JP Morgan and Fidelity… the list of household names with Bitcoin FOMO is getting longer. So why aren’t the crowds going wild? Around the time of the industry’s most important conference of the year – Consensus – earlier this month, Bitcoin shot up by over $1,000 overnight. eBay announced (and later retracted) that it would be accepting cryptocurrency payments. Microsoft came out with its plans to build on the Bitcoin blockchain. North American food chain Whole Foods also joined the revolution and the price started to soar. Yet despite what historically causes a massive “gold rush” of retail investors suffering from Bitcoin FOMO, this rally is far from retail-driven. In fact, it appears to be the institutions that are scared of missing out. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust accumulated 11,236 bitcoin in April alone. Currently 54,000 bitcoin are mined per month. Right now, they are buying up 21% of the new supply of bitcoin. In a year, the halvening will double that number to 42% of the supply. Institutions are FOMOing. — Rhythm (@Rhythmtrader) May 29, 2019  With the Bitcoin halvening happening next year, Bitcoin is becoming more scarce and more valuable. More of it will be owned by institutions. That might sound like a stupid question. After all, the price would just go up, right? Well, yes. However, there are some other indicators that can alert us to a possible retail buying spree. What do most people do when they want to find out more about something? They turn to Google for their answer. Of course, Google may not be the only search engine around the world, with Yandex, Baidu, and a plethora of privacy browsers. But when it comes to market leadership, Google still takes the cake with 88.47% of the market share in April 2019. So, with all the action going on in the markets right now, you would imagine that searches for Bitcoin would be going through the roof. Not so much. In fact, take a look at the information below from Google Trends and you’ll see that interest in Bitcoin is hovering around the same level as it was in May 2017, way before Bitcoin FOMO started in earnest. Out of the countries where Bitcoin searches take the lead, the top three are in Africa. That could be attributed to increasing awareness due to African blockchain conferences, and increasing use cases as well. Where legislation strangles businesses trading internationally, it’s much easier to send and receive payments in Bitcoin. Nigerians have seen a massive devaluation of their local currency in recent years. This could also be behind Bitcoin purchases by people trying to shield their savings. Austria and the Netherlands have recently had major Bitcoin conferences and an outpouring of institutional support that could be driving curiosity. But still… Bitcoin FOMO is not at a significant height anywhere around the world at the moment. Another indicator to use is to look at data form LocalBitcoins for each country. Again, this hardly confirms Bitcoin FOMO. Globally, this week has seen a modest rise in Bitcoin purchases, but it’s still a far and distant cry from the 2017 Bitcoin mania. Even in Nigeria, which registers the most Bitcoin searches, purchasing volume on LocalBitcoins has dropped this week. It could be tighter regulation in countries like China and the US. Or maybe greater education and fear of losing funds from hackers. Perhaps many investors were simply burned last time – buying at an all-time high – and are still waiting to recoup their losses. In terms of returns in 2019, Bitcoin has outperformed every other asset and run circles around oil, gold, commodities, and even the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. With more institutional adoption, increasing trade tensions, and the Bitcoin halvening coming up, the bullish trend looks set to continue. There are some analysts like Tone Vays that are calling for a pullback. However, it appears that the majority of traders and industry experts expect Bitcoin to continue climbing. Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner of Kenetic, recently spoke to Bloomberg and is calling for an all-time high of $30,000 by the end of this year. He is also extremely bullish on Ethereum and Ripple. So, the question definitely isn’t whether Bitcoin FOMO will set in, but when and where it will happen first.

Bitcoin: The route to $10 million," A Reddit user has posted his version of the maths required for a future $10 million Bitcoin valuation. His assumptions are based on a number of factors including the global amount of millionaires, a $260 trillion stock and derivative market, and Bitcoin’s intrinsically scarce supply schedule. BuyBitcoinWhileItsLo started his post by reminding people about the “fundamental fact that only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist”, and that unlike the dollar (which can be printed continuously forever), a Bitcoin is infinitely divisible – “So no matter how expensive one coin gets, infinite fractions of it can be purchased and used.” BuyBitcoinWhileItsLo estimated that “there are 36 million millionaires in the world today”, and “by the time every one of them tries to grab a full Bitcoin when it becomes a must-have investment, there won’t be enough for all of them”. In the Reddit post – which was titled “My best attempt to simplify the math of a 10 million dollar Bitcoin” – the user predicted that this would “easily push one coin past 1 million dollars in value when they [the millionaires] try to grab a whole coin”. Regarding traditional markets, he said “there is $260 trillion in the global stock markets through stocks and derivatives”, or “what others call institutional money”. “Once Bitcoin is allowed to be traded for stocks, that $260 trillion is open to be put behind Bitcoin.” The Reddit user said that when this happens: “$260 trillion divided by 21 million Bitcoins puts one Bitcoin over $10 million a coin, or $12 million a coin to be exact.” “This will likely happen in our lifetime. That makes every dollar invested even at an $11,000 price could be worth $1,000 in possibly 10 years at this rate.” Moving on to the topic of Bitcoin’s supply schedule, BuyBitcoinWhileItsLo said: “Every four years the distribution of Bitcoin going out gets cut in half. So in the first four years 10.5 million Bitcoins went out, and the demand was small so the price was cheap – it went from less than a penny in 2009 to $1,000 in 2013 when it first halved.” “That’s where we are now. So currently only 5.25 million Bitcoins are going out, which is why the price is running up since investors know this, and they always start to buy before a halving to grab coins before there is less to go out.” The Reddit user said: “The next halving is next year – summer 2020. After that, only 2.125 million Bitcoins will be going out with $10 trillion in institutional markets being opened up. The potential is anywhere from $100,000 to $500,000 in the short term by late 2020 or early 2021, then another 80+% drop as usual.” The Bitcoin bull concluded: “At the current prices, you’re in a good position to be fine after the next correction/drop that’ll come after the upcoming halving skyrockets the price. I for one won’t stop accumulating till we break $20,000. My golden rule is to never buy during all-time highs.”   The post Bitcoin: The route to $10 million appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Nawaz Sulemanji,Coin Rivet,2019-06-24T12:05:26.000Z
The top five cryptocurrency exchanges in 2019," At the time of writing, the reality is that most DEXs, or decentralised exchanges, are still quite difficult to use – mostly due to bad user interfaces and user experience. There are a few exceptions (which I will cover later), but the fact of the matter is that to have a great crypto-trading experience, you should probably look into centralised exchanges, mainly because of the additional support and functionality. Even though some crypto-enthusiasts like Vitalik Buterin are quite against the centralisation of exchanges and services – due to the non-custodial aspect of centralisation – it’s an easy way to get started or to trade professionally.

Vitalik Buterin: “I definitely hope centralized exchanges go burn in hell as much as possible” – classic line #ethereum #cryptocurrency — The Crypto Lark (@TheCryptoLark) July 7, 2018  In this short piece, you’ll learn what exchanges I personally like to use and why. I will discuss both DEXs and centralised exchanges, as both have numerous advantages over the other. Binance is probably the most popular and fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Binance’s popularity is a function of its dual-nature interface that provides a “basic” trading experience for beginners and an “advanced” experience for sophisticated traders. Binance supports the deposit and withdrawal of more than 100 coins and is one of the top 10 exchanges in the world in terms of 24-hour trading volumes. Binance offers some of the most competitive trading rates with a flat fee of 0.1% and an additional 25% discount for trades conducted in its native BNB token. The downside to Binance is that it only functions as a crypto-to-crypto exchange and it won’t serve your needs if you want to make a fiat transaction. Binance offers decent customer service, but you might spend some time in a queue before you get through to someone on the phone – but this is a totally understandable scenario considering the sheer size of its operations. At the time of writing, BNB is one of the top performing coins of 2019 due to its increased utility as the go-to token to access hot IEOs (Initial Exchange Offerings). BitMEX is another popular cryptocurrency exchange that has made a name for itself because of its high trading volumes and attendant liquidity, as well as its leverage trading option. It boasts a daily trading volume of more than 35,000 BTC, it records more than 540,000 accesses monthly, and it has reportedly traded $34 billion worth of BTC since it was founded. Traders love BitMEX because it is the only crypto exchange that provides up to 100x leverage for trades. It also provides the option to trade futures and perpetual token swaps. BitMEX has a fee structure that varies for different cryptocurrencies and whether you are placing a futures or leveraged trade. You can typically expect to pay maker fees, taker fees, maintenance fees, settlement fees, and initial margin fees on your trades. There’s a 0.001 BTC minimum deposit limit as well. One of the downsides to BitMEX is that doesn’t have fiat payment options. In fact, it only accepts BTC deposits, which you can then use to purchase other cryptocurrencies. In addition, you can only make withdrawals in BTC. Check out this awesome shoutout to @ChangeNOW_io from @TheCryptoZombie! Thank you so much, K-Dub – looks sweet! 😃 Watch Crypto Zombie's video on YouTube: https://t.co/DEI2HqjguF — ChangeNOW (@ChangeNOW_io) June 6, 2019  ChangeNOW is a non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange service designed to serve the needs of a subset of cryptocurrency users who wish to make direct crypto-to-crypto trades. Many crypto exchanges limit trading options and pairs to the top five cryptocurrencies – you can easily exchange any altcoin for BTC or ETH, but they don’t have trading pairs that allow you to exchange random altcoins with each other directly. With ChangeNOW, users can make direct crypto swaps with any of its 170 supported tokens, with access to more than 30,000 trading pairs and without needing to use BTC or ETH as an intermediate store of value. One of the factors driving the popularity of ChangeNOW is that it doesn’t require users to sign up, create an account, or proceed with any form of registration. In addition, it runs a non-custodial service, meaning it doesn’t charge deposit or withdrawal fees and interest is added to the final rate for the crypto swap. ChangeNOW also boasts impressive transaction speeds, with most transactions being settled in under two minutes. Rarely does a crypto swap take longer than 10 to 20 minutes. A downside is that ChangeNOW doesn’t offer leveraged trading or advanced trading features. Coinbase is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges and offers a simple and highly intuitive UI that makes it ideal for non-expert cryptocurrency users and investors. It also possesses different layers of functionality and allows professional traders and institutional investors to access complex trading solutions through the use of its professional exchange, Coinbase Pro. Coinbase provides the option to purchase crypto with credit cards, debit cards, and wire transfers. One of the key selling points of Coinbase is the quality of its storage as it claims to put users’ funds in cold storage to protect itself against hacks. In addition, it offers two-factor authentication to ensure that user accounts are secure. One of the downsides of using Coinbase is that its fees are relatively pricey in comparison to other exchanges. For instance, it charges 3% to 5% for credit card deposits. Coinbase also offers OTC options and portfolio management to institutions or large private investors. In 2018 Ethereum miners earned $148M in gas fees, and IDEX users paid $4.4M of them! We talk about how we’re scaling IDEX to reduce gas costs and more in our Q1 update: https://t.co/oC2WcozoM1 #ethereum #IDEX $AURA — IDEX (@idexio) May 1, 2019  The IDEX exchange is part of the Aurora project, which is a collection of Ethereum applications and protocols that make up a decentralised banking and finance platform. IDEX, as the name indicates, is a decentralised exchange where users own their private-public key pairs. To trade, users sign transactions using interfaces such as MetaMask. IDEX offers trading pairs in ETH or DAI (not on BTC due to it being built on Ethereum). As an Ethereum-based exchange, IDEX deals exclusively in Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. IDEX also incorporates the AURA token – the exchange’s native currency – which encourages users to stake the coin and help support the network. The AURA token enables stakers to earn a share of fees generated by IDEX and other Aurora products. By staking AURA, node operators will be rewarded proportionately to their percentage stake, and 50% of fees have been allocated to be paid to AURA stakers. Traders will also be able to utilise the Boreal coin as a payment option for trading fees or as a stable base currency. Market makers or users who create a new order for the order book and improve liquidity are charged a maker fee of 0.1%. Takers, or anyone who fills an order on the book and takes away liquidity, are charged a fee of 0.2%. To conclude this piece on the exchanges I personally like to use, I would like to briefly mention XCOEX, a brand new exchange that was launched just last month. XCOEX’s main strategy focuses on providing unparalleled support, quality trading tools, and easily-accessible services for both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and digital beginners from around the world. The exchange features fast KYC and a user-friendly interface available in multiple languages. In addition, XCOEX is currently running a promotion for new users who register to the platform during June 2019. A daily competition is currently ongoing on XCOEX’s YouTube channel and $1,000 worth of BCH is being awarded to one new user every day. To enjoy the promotion, newly registered users need to complete the following simple tasks: 2) We have a limited offer for the #promo participants: The minimum deposit is only $20 dollars now!  So hurry up, make a deposit if you have not done it yet and become the first to win $1,000 tomorrow! — xcoex (@xcoex) May 31, 2019  That’s it!

3," This post first appeared in Frank Chaparro’s weekly column “Mad Crypto,” which is sent to Genesis members’ inbox every Monday morning.  Pundits and media professionals often struggle to pinpoint the Holy Grail behind each bitcoin price increase. And the 17.2% increase this past week to around $11,000, its highest point in over 15 months, is no different. Naturally, Facebook’s Libra announcement is alluded to at the bottom of many “price posts” out there (such as this one from the Financial Times).  But as our friend Lionel Laurent at Bloomberg News points out in his Sunday morning column, readers would be unwise to attribute bitcoin’s bullish run over the past week solely to Mark Zuckerberg’s plan to gatecrash the digital currency market with a stablecoin-like token backed by giants such as PayPal, Uber, and Visa.  Join Genesis now and continue reading, Mad Crypto: Libra was just the cherry on top of this rally!",Frank Chaparro,The Block,2019-06-24T13:50:14.000Z
Vancouver Bitcoin ATM ban will ‘disproportionately affect’ sex workers," The first Bitcoin was installed in Vancouver during 2013. But now the Mayor of the Canadian city is proposing a ban on the machines, arguing that they open the door to money laundering. It’s important to remember who exactly is using them; some of these people are often on society’s fringes, especially sex workers. Vancouver’s potential ban on such machines will affect that vulnerable group disproportionately, argues Ethan Lou, a former journalist who these days runs a mining company in Canada and whose first book, Once a Bitcoin Miner, will be published next year. In an article for The Globe and Mail, he says: “Make no mistake, the issue of Bitcoin ATMs is one of social class. Sex workers use cryptocurrency to buy ads or run websites because credit card issuers often refuse to work with the platforms and hosting services that cater to their industry. Using cryptocurrency also grants a certain anonymity, which is of particular importance; many sex workers deliberately avoid using online exchange platforms, which have lower fees, but often require bank accounts, credit cards, a fixed address or other identification.” What makes the ATMs attractive to sex workers is also attractive to money launderers, Lou concedes. “British Columbia has wide-ranging issues with dirty money and it is not a stretch to say the ATMs could be involved. But cleaning ill-gotten gains is almost as old as sex work. Are Bitcoin ATMs used more so than, or even as frequently as, restaurants, casinos, convenience stores or any other business?” Ultimately, those who launder money might end up little affected, he argues. With the right will and means, it is not hard to buy Bitcoin anonymously for cheaper than through ATMs. “As the City of Vancouver goes about its research, it is incumbent upon staff to at least consult the sex workers who, through no fault of their own, are caught in someone else’s fight, potentially made to suffer from someone else’s sins,” Lou concludes.

5," The Raspberry Pi Foundation has released a new, more powerful model of its single-board computer. The new device will cost $35 a unit and has the capacity to run full nodes cheaply on the Bitcoin network. Earlier versions of the Raspberry Pi have been popular with Bitcoin enthusiasts and decentralisation advocates as it provides a low barrier to entry for those interested in running their own full nodes on the network. Raspberry Pi 4 is here! A tiny, dual-display desktop computer, with three RAM variants to choose from, and all the hackability you know and love. On sale now from the familiar price of $35: https://t.co/d9iwVidexm #RaspberryPi4 pic.twitter.com/4fll4gx1Ax — Raspberry Pi (@Raspberry_Pi) June 24, 2019  Using the device to run a Bitcoin node allows users to verify their own transactions over the Bitcoin network independently without having to trust third-party wallets or custodial service providers. Unlike miners, who are rewarded with BTC for validating transactions, full nodes do not get compensation for their contribution to the network in the form of hosting and transmitting updated copies of the blockchain (or distributed transaction ledger).   At the time of writing, of the 10,516 reachable Bitcoin nodes on the network, we can see that almost 40% are geographically located in either the United States or Germany. The new Raspberry Pi model (4th version) represents a significant upgrade on earlier versions. Its most expensive option – with 4GB of RAM – will cost just $55 (excluding tax). It also comes with a new operating system, which the Foundation claims comes with a host of back-end technical improvements, a modernised interface, plus support for updated applications such as the Chromium 74 web browser. In the years since Pi’s initial release in 2012, other hardware options have emerged for use as a Bitcoin full node as well. These include HTC’s Exodus 1S smartphone, which has Bitcoin full node capability and was released this May. For more news, guides, and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.

Bitcoin price surge is not just about Facebook's crypto push," Bitcoin is up an eye-popping 245% in 2019 so far. And based on many business news headlines of the past week, you’d think bitcoin’s surge is all thanks to Facebook (FB). But bitcoin was already up nearly 200% before June 18, when Facebook announced its plans to launch a cryptocurrency called Libra next year and a digital wallet called Calibra. And the Facebook news initially sent bitcoin lower for the first few days, before it recovered. The initial thinking in some circles after Facebook’s announcement was that Libra, which has big-name backers like Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, Spotify, Uber, and Lyft on board as “founding members,” will be bad for bitcoin, especially since the Libra Association says it aims for Libra to “put the term ‘currency’ back in cryptocurrency” by being a coin for everyday use. Libra Association’s head of policy Dante Disparte even took a clear shot at bitcoin, telling Yahoo Finance that Libra coin, “is designed to be a unit of purchase and a unit of daily transactions, as opposed to a speculative asset—which is, candidly, where many cryptocurrencies have stood.” One of the biggest mainstream criticisms of bitcoin has been that it’s merely become a speculative investment, not for regular use as an actual currency. But as the dust has settled from Facebook’s and Libra’s simultaneous June 18 announcements, more people in the cryptocurrency space are reasoning that the embrace of blockchain technology by Facebook and its other mainstream partners is an inherent endorsement of bitcoin. It is the “rising tide lifts all boats” argument. (Of course, the bitcoin community was quick to question whether Libra is truly decentralized, since Facebook executives are behind it, and whether Libra’s planned blockchain is a true “permissionless” ledger.) In other words: Facebook’s crypto push is likely at least partially helping push other cryptocurrencies higher. But it’s far from the main driver. So what’s the real reason bitcoin is moving higher in 2019? CME Group, which launched bitcoin futures trading back in December 2017, tweeted on June 18 about the “growing signs of institutional interest.” CME says it saw a new all-time high of bitcoin futures contracts on June 17.   CME Bitcoin futures (BTC) shows growing signs of institutional interest. BTC open interest rose by a record 643 contracts in a single day, establishing a new all-time high of 5,311 contracts on June 17 (26,555 equivalent bitcoin; ~$250M notional). https://t.co/I6A3jD6Iq3 pic.twitter.com/ljz6EbvK79 Grayscale Investments has also seen big gains for its publicly traded bitcoin fund Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), up 330% this year. In May, the firm launched a “Drop Gold” television ad campaign to push bitcoin as an investment class. There is a lot of positive institutional crypto news in the water recently. JPMorgan launched its own internal cryptocurrency, JPM Coin. The CFTC this week approved LedgerX to offer bitcoin derivatives contracts, and to settle them in actual bitcoin. And a report this month from Bitwise, highlighted by JPMorgan analysts, determined that institutional interest in the bitcoin futures market “has been significantly understated.” This has prompted the thinking that unlike the price hike at the end of 2017, which was driven by retail buying, “This time is different.” That’s how Genesis Trading CEO Michael Moro frames it too. “This is a very different market today than it was in 2017,” he says. “2019 has less distractions. It's also a different space because the CME bitcoin futures product wasn’t available until December 2017.” Genesis says its trading volumes are two to three times higher than they were 12 months ago. Lightning Labs, which offers a scaling alternative to the bitcoin blockchain and has been gaining momentum recently thanks to support from Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, released its first mobile app on Wednesday and saw an immediate flood of downloads. And then there are the geopolitical factors. Many believe that President Trump’s endless trade war and tariff tit-for-tat with China (and threats of tariffs on other countries) has buoyed bitcoin, which is seen as a safe haven asset like gold. And earlier this month, European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi suggested the need for more ECB monetary stimulus, prompting criticism from Trump—that also was seen as a boon to bitcoin. All of these factors have likely had a far bigger impact on the bitcoin price over the past few months than Facebook. — Daniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

75," Craig Wright, the leading proponent of Bitcoin SV who says he is the creator of Bitcoin, claimed in Florida federal court on Friday that he is unable to easily access the $10 billion bitcoin fortune or even produce the addresses at which the coins are stored. Wright is in court to defend himself against the estate of his former business partner Dave Kleiman, which claims he stole bitcoin belonging to Kleiman. Wright claimed that Kleiman was responsible for hiding the bitcoin jointly owned by the two men in order to protect Wright's identity as the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. According to Wright, ""I brought in Dave because he was a friend and he knew who I was and he was a forensic expert, and I wanted to wipe everything I had to do with Bitcoin from the public record."" Kleiman's estate is highly motivated to retrieve the bitcoin, while Wright claims that his family has ""enough now"" and the missing bitcoin would be ""too much money."" The estate claims that Wright forged a significant number of documents following Kleiman's death in 2013 in order to transfer to himself all of the jointly owned bitcoin. Wright reportedly became emotional in the courtroom, which was cleared of any electronic devices, and lamented that his purported monetary creation was used for illicit activities on Silk Road and elsewhere. As a result, Wright says he stopped mining and working on Bitcoin in 2010. If Wright and Kleiman's estate really do own the bitcoin they're claiming, both have much at stake in the proceedings, as the value of bitcoin owned by the elusive creator of the cryptocurrency is now worth well over $10 billion. And with Wright currently leading Bitcoin SV, valued at nearly $4 billion, he can ill afford to have his reputation sullied at trial. During the hearing, Wright turned combative on a number of occasions, throwing a document and using profane language. This caused the judge to warn Wright that he would be ""in handcuffs"" if he did not get himself under control.  The hearing concluded with the matter far from settled. It will reportedly be continued later this summer.",The Block,None,2019-06-29T13:14:15.000Z
Bitcoin Bulls on Fire as Prices Leap to Fresh Yearly High," Open your FXTM account today Investors wasted to no time rushing back to the crypto asset on rumours revolving around Facebook launching its own cryptocurrency. Market optimism about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies becoming widely accepted and adopted by mainstream entities could inspire bulls to target $10,000 in the medium to longer term. While the path of least resistance for Bitcoin currently points north amid the positivity, investors should not overlook how inherently volatile and unpredictable cryptocurrencies can be. Focusing on the technical picture, BTCUSD remains bullish on the daily charts. A solid daily close above $9300 should invite a move higher towards $9500 and $9700, respectively. Should $9000 prove to be unreliable support, Bitcoin is seen sinking back towards $8000.

," Bitcoin Cash ABC slid by 5% on Thursday. Reversing a 2.25% gain from Wednesday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $398.17. Relatively range-bound through most of the day, Bitcoin Cash ABC rose to a mid-morning intraday high $420.79 before falling to a late morning low $410.9. Whilst steering clear of the major support and resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell back through the 23.6% FIB of $418. A brief visit to $419 levels was short-lived, with Bitcoin Cash ABC sliding to an intraday low $398.17 in the final hour of the day. The sell-off saw Bitcoin Cash ABC slide through the 23.6% FIB and first major support level at $407.36. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 0.9% to $401.77. A relatively bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $396.33 to a high $402.01. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, Bitcoin Cash ABC would need to move through to $406 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $413.25. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need support from the broader market, however, to break through to $410 levels. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin Cash ABC could take a run at $420 levels. Failure to move through to $406 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC hit reverse. A fall through the morning low $396.33 would bring the first major support level at $390.63 into play. Barring another crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$390 support levels on the day. Litecoin fell by 1.8% on Thursday. Partially reversing 2.69% rise from Wednesday, Litecoin ended the day at $119.59. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin rally from a morning low $119.03 to a late morning intraday high $127.37. Steering clear of the major support levels, Litecoin broke through the first major resistance level at $124.22 and second major resistance level at $126.66. After pulling back to $121 levels Litecoin managed a return to $126 levels before succumbing to market forces. A final hour sell-off saw Litecoin slide to an intraday low $118.59. In spite of the sell-off, Litecoin left the first major support level at $118.28 untested on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 0.05% to $119.53. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a low $118.5 to a high $120.14 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move through to $122 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $124.96. Litecoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at Thursday’s high $127.37. An early move through to $125 levels would bring the second major resistance level at $130.34 into play. Failure to move through to $122 levels could see Litecoin fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $118.5 would bring the 23.6% FIB of $117 into play before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Litecoin should steer clear of the first major support level at $116.62. Ripple’s XRP slid by 4.47% on Thursday. Reversing a 1.33% from Wednesday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.38787. Bearish from the start of the day, Ripple’s XRP fell from an early intraday high $0.40659 to a late intraday low $0.3857. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Ripple’s XRP fell through the first major support level at $0.3984 and second major support level at $0.3914. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 0.01% to $0.38783. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from a morning high $0.3892 to a low $0.3844 before steadying. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move through to $0.3935 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $0.4011. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, for a break out from $0.3950 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP will likely come up short of $0.40 levels on the day. Failure to move through to $0.3935 levels could see Ripple’s XRP fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $0.3844 would bring the first major support level at $0.3802 into play. An extended sell-off through the day could see Ripple’s XRP fall to sub-$0.38 levels before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of the second major support level at $0.3725.

2," Bitcoin has been on a tear since the beginning of the year, but its impressive 220% rise has not helped apps tied to the market, according to a Bloomberg News report.  Data from App Annie shows that downloads in cryptocurrency-related apps has flattened from 2018 to 2019, despite bitcoin's price surge from $4,000 at the beginning of the year to over $10,000.  According to the app analytics provider, downloads of the more than 6,500 apps related to cryptocurrency only picked up a few million from 65.8 million during the first half of 2018 compared to 67 million during the first half of 2019.  Still, the number of crypto apps has increase 35% from 2018.  The lack of interest in crypto apps further illustrates the difference between the 2019 bull market in crypto-assets relative to the one at the end of 2017.  As pointed out by The Block Director of Research Larry Cermak, there has been virtually zero spike in Google searches for the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, and Bitfinex. ",Frank Chaparro,The Block,2019-06-29T17:13:01.000Z
1," At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading just above $11,450 after price crashed close to 23% from $13,800 to $10,500 during the previous week. It seems the hypothesis that weekends are good for Bitcoin may not always be true, even though the price is now higher than it was one week ago as BTC consolidated above the key $11,000 level on Sunday. Will Bitcoin push higher during the week? Or will we see more major retracements back to the $10,000 region? Bitcoin is evolving as expected. Its overall value keeps increasing, and if you look at the volumes profile on the left of the graph above, you’ll notice there’s plenty of volume keeping BTC above the critical $11,000 level. My prediction that Bitcoin could hit $20,000 by the end of the year could turn into an “end of the month” kind of deal. Assuming the positive trend continues and BTC price continues to rise, we should expect higher volumes coming in at key levels close to $20,000. Although many retail investors will be looking to sell some of their gains when Bitcoin hits all-time highs again, we can expect the price to keep going at least for a few weeks. However, as the market becomes more liquid, we should expect fewer violent swings, so it could take longer for BTC to reach a new high. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal – not only in shorter time frames but also in daily and weekly ones as well – I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past two weeks, volume has gone from $17 billion to $23 billion, consolidating now around $20 billion. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $15,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Of course, if you think I might be overreacting to positive news, you can always check what other expert analysts have to say about this recent price movement. Hopefully, the market will continue this positive momentum. Pay attention to retracements back down towards the 200-day EMA to make new entries. Safe trades!

Facebook’s new Libra cryptocurrency aiming for ‘permissionless consensus’," Facebook has today announced its new cryptocurrency and has revealed that its “ambition is for the Libra network to become permissionless”. The Libra network website claims that a key distinction in the blockchain space is the one between permissioned systems, “in which only a defined set of entities can shape consensus and governance”, and permissionless systems, “where anyone that follows the rules of the protocol and contributes the right types of resources” has a say. The team said that the distinction is important “not only from a technical perspective, but also from an economic one”. The Libra team described how permissionless systems have “low barriers to entry and innovation” and can be “resistant to censorship attacks”. This type of network architecture can “encourage healthy competition among infrastructure providers” as well as developers of applications on top of the network.  “Since nobody can exclude others from the market or censor their transactions, permissionless systems provide stronger guarantees to participants that no single party will be able to unilaterally change the rules of the network to their advantage at a future date. At their core, permissionless systems make irreversible commitments to operating as open networks where changes can only be implemented if they are democratically supported by a majority of constituents.”  “Since nobody can exclude others from the market or censor their transactions, permissionless systems provide stronger guarantees to participants that no single party will be able to unilaterally change the rules of the network to their advantage at a future date. At their core, permissionless systems make irreversible commitments to operating as open networks where changes can only be implemented if they are democratically supported by a majority of constituents.” The website reads: “To ensure that Libra is truly open, our ambition is for the Libra network to become permissionless.” However, the team also said: “The challenge is that as of today, we do not believe that there is a proven solution that can deliver the scale, stability, and security needed to support billions of people and transactions across the globe through a permissionless network. “With the testnet, the association starts the journey toward building a permissionless system. “We believe that for the Libra network to achieve its full potential, it needs to be permissionless. As a result, one of the association’s directives will be to work with the community to research and implement this transition, which will begin within five years of the public launch of the Libra Blockchain and ecosystem.” The project has revealed that in both its permissioned and permissionless states, the Libra Blockchain will be open, meaning any consumer, developer, or business can use the Libra network and build products on top of it. I'm going to run a Libra validator node. 😏https://t.co/jwJiAZSiFe pic.twitter.com/pjxvXXskQd — Julien Bouteloup (@bneiluj) June 18, 2019  In its glossary, Libra said that “on a permissionless network, anyone who meets certain technical requirements can access the network or operate a node”. This statement is obviously true for other major public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum that allow any participant to contribute towards either consensus or the ability to send transactions (uncensored) across its public blockchains. The network will kick off in 2020 using a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus approach among a group of validator nodes run by its Libra Association members. It has been revealed that the current ‘buy-in’ to run a node is around $10 million (of Libra investment tokens) and that this node network will have the ability to exert centralised control over the Libra Blockchain. Becoming permissionless will allow any participant to run a node (and take part in consensus) but also have a say in what may or may not be allowed to be processed on the Libra Blockchain from a technical perspective. If the project can fulfill its claim to be truly permissionless and open in five years’ time, then it may actually be a viable competitor to not just the mainstream banks, but also the truly open and decentralised cryptocurrencies that dominate the digital assets industry today.

," At the time of writing, the reality is that most DEXs, or decentralised exchanges, are still quite difficult to use – mostly due to bad user interfaces and user experience. There are a few exceptions (which I will cover later), but the fact of the matter is that to have a great crypto-trading experience, you should probably look into centralised exchanges, mainly because of the additional support and functionality. Even though some crypto-enthusiasts like Vitalik Buterin are quite against the centralisation of exchanges and services – due to the non-custodial aspect of centralisation – it’s an easy way to get started or to trade professionally.

Vitalik Buterin: “I definitely hope centralized exchanges go burn in hell as much as possible” – classic line #ethereum #cryptocurrency — The Crypto Lark (@TheCryptoLark) July 7, 2018  In this short piece, you’ll learn what exchanges I personally like to use and why. I will discuss both DEXs and centralised exchanges, as both have numerous advantages over the other. Binance is probably the most popular and fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchange in the world. Binance’s popularity is a function of its dual-nature interface that provides a “basic” trading experience for beginners and an “advanced” experience for sophisticated traders. Binance supports the deposit and withdrawal of more than 100 coins and is one of the top 10 exchanges in the world in terms of 24-hour trading volumes. Binance offers some of the most competitive trading rates with a flat fee of 0.1% and an additional 25% discount for trades conducted in its native BNB token. The downside to Binance is that it only functions as a crypto-to-crypto exchange and it won’t serve your needs if you want to make a fiat transaction. Binance offers decent customer service, but you might spend some time in a queue before you get through to someone on the phone – but this is a totally understandable scenario considering the sheer size of its operations. At the time of writing, BNB is one of the top performing coins of 2019 due to its increased utility as the go-to token to access hot IEOs (Initial Exchange Offerings). BitMEX is another popular cryptocurrency exchange that has made a name for itself because of its high trading volumes and attendant liquidity, as well as its leverage trading option. It boasts a daily trading volume of more than 35,000 BTC, it records more than 540,000 accesses monthly, and it has reportedly traded $34 billion worth of BTC since it was founded. Traders love BitMEX because it is the only crypto exchange that provides up to 100x leverage for trades. It also provides the option to trade futures and perpetual token swaps. BitMEX has a fee structure that varies for different cryptocurrencies and whether you are placing a futures or leveraged trade. You can typically expect to pay maker fees, taker fees, maintenance fees, settlement fees, and initial margin fees on your trades. There’s a 0.001 BTC minimum deposit limit as well. One of the downsides to BitMEX is that doesn’t have fiat payment options. In fact, it only accepts BTC deposits, which you can then use to purchase other cryptocurrencies. In addition, you can only make withdrawals in BTC. Check out this awesome shoutout to @ChangeNOW_io from @TheCryptoZombie! Thank you so much, K-Dub – looks sweet! 😃 Watch Crypto Zombie's video on YouTube: https://t.co/DEI2HqjguF — ChangeNOW (@ChangeNOW_io) June 6, 2019  ChangeNOW is a non-custodial cryptocurrency exchange service designed to serve the needs of a subset of cryptocurrency users who wish to make direct crypto-to-crypto trades. Many crypto exchanges limit trading options and pairs to the top five cryptocurrencies – you can easily exchange any altcoin for BTC or ETH, but they don’t have trading pairs that allow you to exchange random altcoins with each other directly. With ChangeNOW, users can make direct crypto swaps with any of its 170 supported tokens, with access to more than 30,000 trading pairs and without needing to use BTC or ETH as an intermediate store of value. One of the factors driving the popularity of ChangeNOW is that it doesn’t require users to sign up, create an account, or proceed with any form of registration. In addition, it runs a non-custodial service, meaning it doesn’t charge deposit or withdrawal fees and interest is added to the final rate for the crypto swap. ChangeNOW also boasts impressive transaction speeds, with most transactions being settled in under two minutes. Rarely does a crypto swap take longer than 10 to 20 minutes. A downside is that ChangeNOW doesn’t offer leveraged trading or advanced trading features. Coinbase is one of the oldest cryptocurrency exchanges and offers a simple and highly intuitive UI that makes it ideal for non-expert cryptocurrency users and investors. It also possesses different layers of functionality and allows professional traders and institutional investors to access complex trading solutions through the use of its professional exchange, Coinbase Pro. Coinbase provides the option to purchase crypto with credit cards, debit cards, and wire transfers. One of the key selling points of Coinbase is the quality of its storage as it claims to put users’ funds in cold storage to protect itself against hacks. In addition, it offers two-factor authentication to ensure that user accounts are secure. One of the downsides of using Coinbase is that its fees are relatively pricey in comparison to other exchanges. For instance, it charges 3% to 5% for credit card deposits. Coinbase also offers OTC options and portfolio management to institutions or large private investors. In 2018 Ethereum miners earned $148M in gas fees, and IDEX users paid $4.4M of them! We talk about how we’re scaling IDEX to reduce gas costs and more in our Q1 update: https://t.co/oC2WcozoM1 #ethereum #IDEX $AURA — IDEX (@idexio) May 1, 2019  The IDEX exchange is part of the Aurora project, which is a collection of Ethereum applications and protocols that make up a decentralised banking and finance platform. IDEX, as the name indicates, is a decentralised exchange where users own their private-public key pairs. To trade, users sign transactions using interfaces such as MetaMask. IDEX offers trading pairs in ETH or DAI (not on BTC due to it being built on Ethereum). As an Ethereum-based exchange, IDEX deals exclusively in Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. IDEX also incorporates the AURA token – the exchange’s native currency – which encourages users to stake the coin and help support the network. The AURA token enables stakers to earn a share of fees generated by IDEX and other Aurora products. By staking AURA, node operators will be rewarded proportionately to their percentage stake, and 50% of fees have been allocated to be paid to AURA stakers. Traders will also be able to utilise the Boreal coin as a payment option for trading fees or as a stable base currency. Market makers or users who create a new order for the order book and improve liquidity are charged a maker fee of 0.1%. Takers, or anyone who fills an order on the book and takes away liquidity, are charged a fee of 0.2%. To conclude this piece on the exchanges I personally like to use, I would like to briefly mention XCOEX, a brand new exchange that was launched just last month. XCOEX’s main strategy focuses on providing unparalleled support, quality trading tools, and easily-accessible services for both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and digital beginners from around the world. The exchange features fast KYC and a user-friendly interface available in multiple languages. In addition, XCOEX is currently running a promotion for new users who register to the platform during June 2019. A daily competition is currently ongoing on XCOEX’s YouTube channel and $1,000 worth of BCH is being awarded to one new user every day. To enjoy the promotion, newly registered users need to complete the following simple tasks: 2) We have a limited offer for the #promo participants: The minimum deposit is only $20 dollars now!

," It was another day for the Bitcoin bulls. Bitcoin rallied by 9.7% on Wednesday. Following on from a 6.03% gain on Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $12,876. It was a 9th consecutive day of gains for the Bitcoin bulls. Bullish through most of the day, Bitcoin rallied from an early intraday low $11,684.5 to a late intraday high and new swing hi $13,764. Steering well clear of the major support levels, Bitcoin broke through the major resistance levels before a late sell-off. The late sell-off saw Bitcoin slide back to $11,780 levels before bouncing back. A late recovery saw Bitcoin break back through to $12,000 levels to close out the day with solid gains. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was another mixed bag for the rest of the pack. Joining Bitcoin in the green on the day were Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash ABC, with gains of 5.77% and 1.90% respectively. It was red for the rest of the top 10. Leading the way down were Bitcoin Cash SV and EOS. The pair fell by 7.93% and 6.04% respectively. Litecoin and Stellar’s Lumen also saw relatively heavy losses, falling by 3.6% and by 2.35% respectively. Ripple’s XRP and Binance Coin saw more modest losses of 1.27% and 0.95% respectively. The moves through Tuesday saw Bitcoin’s dominance hit 63% levels. Bitcoin drove the total crypto market cap to $370bn levels on the day, up from $336.68bn on Tuesday. The Bitcoin rally also drew in sidelined investors. 24-hour trading volumes jumped from $71bn levels to $130bn levels on the day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 2.45% to $12,561.0. A choppy start to the day saw Bitcoin hit a morning high $13,242 before sliding to a morning low $12,371. In spite of the choppy start, Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. Elsewhere, it was a sea of red across the majors. Stellar’s Lumen was down by 3.54% at the time of writing. Bitcoin Cash ABC (-2.52%), Binance Coin (-2.77%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (-2.04%) were also deep in the red. Through the early hours, Ethereum saw the most modest of losses, down by 1.25%. Bitcoin would need to move back through to $12,780 levels to support another break through to $13,000 levels. Following the recent string of gains, however, Bitcoin would need support from the broader market to break out from this morning’s high $13,242. Barring a return to $13,000 levels by the early afternoon, Bitcoin would likely come up short of the first major resistance level at $13,865.17. Failure to move back through to $12,780 levels could see Bitcoin fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $12,371 would bring sub-$12,000 levels into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, however, the first major support level at $11,785.67 should limit the downside on the day.

Why I think Facebook and Libra may be a good thing," So now the old guard of the big tech companies have announced their intention to join the new world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. It was only ever a matter of time. But what does this mean for Bitcoin, and the wider blockchain space? There is a huge amount to unpack from the white paper, so I’m not able to breakdown the whole lot, but my view today is that through Libra and Facebook, the words “blockchain” and “cryptocurrency” will start to become more trusted and a more comfortable lexicon for those not currently anywhere near this space – this is a good thing overall for the industry… First let’s get clear on the distinctions between Libra and Bitcoin; Bitcoin is generally viewed as a future store of value, as today it is not a cheap, fast or effective way to send small amounts of money (until a solid layer 2 solution can be implemented at scale), but with a finite supply and a pre-programmed flow of new coins, it’s a deflationary currency – something we’ve not had for a long time. So potentially Bitcoin is good as an investment asset/product, but not really as a medium of exchange or a unit of account. Libra, on the other hand, will be pegged to a basket of government-issued currencies (and bonds?) and will be relatively stable in value, by comparison, meaning that it is still impacted by inflationary pressures inherent to those currencies. Although purists won’t view Libra as either blockchain or a real cryptocurrency, it definitely has aspects of both. Libra should be viewed as digital money, easily purchased and transacted with, but not a very good store of value (SoV) unless you are in a country suffering from hyperinflation. Libra will benefit from being accessible through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and their two billion daily active users. Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp will drive consumer adoption of Libra and when enough consumers have Libra, merchants will follow. Facebook will create both sides of the ecosystem through its sheer size. With a large base of consumers and merchants as its engine, Libra can deliver frictionless payments to friends, family and businesses across (almost) all borders at speed with no transaction costs. Facebook has managed to bring in some of the biggest brands and companies into the Libra foundation including Visa, Mastercard, Uber and PayPal as well as some big players in the venture capital space. Each member of the foundation pays $10million. The money is used to support the underlying basis for the Libra coin value. Additionally, members of the foundation run the computers (nodes) of the Libra blockchain creating the basis for distributed ledger and decentralised control. This raises questions – and eyebrows – about what those companies might then do with the sensitive financial data they may now be privy to? Facebook has already had to weather the storm of negative press and congressional hearings around how they use data, and whether the public will trust them not to utilise that data for ad targeting – they’ve said they won’t, but the key word is “trust”. No doubt, Libra’s biggest obstacle to success will be governments around the world, their central banks, and the regulators who want to ensure consumers are protected, and no unfair advantages are given to any entities. It was only a few weeks ago that we saw the SEC move on Kik and their token Kin. Kik promotes the Kin token as a utility, whilst the SEC put forward their interpretation that the Kin token is a security. They believe the Kin token was purchased with a view that investors could hold and make a profit. Unsurprisingly, Kik have come out fighting (they didn’t have much choice though really). If the value of the Libra coin is to be based on the value of a basket of currencies, bonds and other assets, then its value will not be pegged to any single currency. This makes Libra a new unit of account when adoption and utility reach a critical mass. I really can’t see the Federal Reserve rolling over and allowing a new sovereign currency to suck value away from the dollar – effectively the global reserve currency. Suddenly, many of the cypherpunks and crypto-anarchists will be rooting for a multi-billion dollar corporate behemoth and its corporate buddies. As the saying goes, “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” – right? It definitely looks that way today. Libra will have a net positive effect on Bitcoin and the wider Blockchain space, just through the massive PR machine that is Facebook. Facebook has not snatched at this play. They’ve put smart people on it, taken their time, and really considered how best to execute. Facebook knows how to execute, and they’ve seemingly done it every time (from newsfeed updates to smart acquisitions), and the one thing you know they’ll get right is a smooth user experience that your grandma can use – do not underestimate just how important this is. Libra can only be a good thing for awareness. With Libra, Joe Public can start learning “what’s this Bitcoin thing is all about?”. Libra will also make corporates start to consider the role of consortia and decentralisation through utilising blockchain, and what issues that may solve for their respective industries. Ultimately, only time will tell as to how successful Libra coin will be for all parties involved, but right now, I wouldn’t bet against Libra’s success. And I hope that in turn, this will drive greater understanding of Bitcoin, and society’s need for sound money.

Latest Bitcoin price and analysis (BTC to USD)," At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading just above $11,055 after price crashed close to 23% from $13,800 to $10,500 during the weekend. It seems the hypothesis that weekends are good for Bitcoin may not always be true, even though Bitcoin price is now higher than it was one week ago as BTC consolidated above the key $11,000 level during Sunday. Will Bitcoin bounce back? Or will we see more major retracements back to the $7,000 – $8,000 region? Bitcoin has experienced a major rally that has taken its price upwards close to 50% over the past few weeks. Even with minor retracements, the market is moving positively with higher lows each time it falls, meaning we should expect BTC to continue its climb towards $13,000 – which in my opinion might come within the next couple of weeks. Last week, I also mentioned how I’m still bullish even though I believe we’ll see 30% to 40% corrections. Prominent Bitcoin trader davincij15 has claimed all bull markets are expected to suffer large corrections of around 30-35% of the total highs in the early stages. This means we could still see Bitcoin touching its 100-day EMA or even its 200-day EMA despite the bull cycle (which can last a couple of years). Don’t forget we’ve seen similar movements during previous cycles in 2013 and 2016-2017. Nevertheless, I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal, I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Corrections are expected and welcomed so that we can accumulate even during bull seasons. $10,000 per bitcoin is absolutely justified given the current level of adoption.  The Bitcoin blockchain has remained consistently above 3.5 TPS since January (1st graph) & deals @LocalBitcoins has remained above $50 million a week since reaching this level in 2017 (2nd graph). pic.twitter.com/zHa2AgOD4A — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) June 21, 2019  Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past two weeks, volume has gone from $17 billion to $23 billion, consolidating now around $20 billion. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $15,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Of course, if you think I might be overreacting to positive news, you can always check what other expert analysts have to say about this recent price movement. Hopefully, the market will continue this positive momentum. Pay attention to retracements back down towards the 200-day EMA to make new entries. Safe trades!

11," Facebook’s (FB) ambitious cryptocurrency project ‘Calibra’ comes as the social media behemoth continues to face scrutiny about data privacy. While Calibra may actually amplify those concerns for some, at least one expert thinks it may help alter the way people view the platform’s data-sharing practices. “This is kind of their ‘Hail Mary’ to actually change the way you look at privacy, but also their ability to grow their next billion dollar market,” R ""Ray"" Wang, Constellation Research Principal Analyst & Founder tells Yahoo Finance’s “The Ticker.” In its description of Calibra, Facebook states explicitly: “Calibra will not share account information or financial data with Facebook, Inc or any third party without customer consent. For example, Calibra customers’ account information and financial data will not be used to improve ad targeting on the Facebook, Inc family of products.” Facebook nevertheless faces an uphill battle. On Tuesday, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) called on the social media company to “agree to a moratorium on any movement forward on developing a cryptocurrency until Congress and regulators have the opportunity to examine these issues.” With Calibra, Facebook is aiming to shakeup the global payment industry. “This is basically the next version of PayPal. If PayPal were to evolve, it would have become a crypto that’s in a P2P (peer-to-peer) digital custodial wallet,” Wang said. “What they’re smartly doing is creating these joint ventures around what we call data-driven digital networks.” In fact, PayPal (PYPL) is one of the 28 founding members part of the ‘Libra Association,’ that will oversee the new digital coin. Other partners include Mastercard (MA), eBay (EBAY) and Uber Technologies (UBER). Wang also predicts Facebook’s cryptocurrency could revamp cross-border commerce. “Just like what’s happening in China today with Alipay, there needs to be an equivalent,” he said. “Because we’re seeing basically a U.S. versus China kind of war on the Internet and on all things digital lifestyle.” — McKenzie Stratigopoulos is a producer at Yahoo Finance.

," It seems that the long-awaited alt-season may finally have arrived after Bitcoin’s market cap dominance fell from 60% to 55% following strong rallies for a number of prominent altcoins. With Bitcoin’s dominance falling over 2% in the last few days alone, we have seen breakouts for many top-10 market cap projects. Bitcoin SV, for example, is up over 140% in a week, with other large-cap projects like Ethereum and Litecoin up over 22% and 36% respectively. Over the same time period, Bitcoin saw its own breakout to fresh 2019 highs with a comparatively paltry 15% move to the upside. Unconventional industry analyst the Crypto Dog has stated that “we haven’t seen nothing yet” until both ETH and BTC “blow the lid on this flag”. His “I have a bag” hashtag appeared to signify that the technical trader is gearing up to sell off some of his alt collection. For many alt-projects, margin trading is not really an option, so the only way to realise really huge profits would be to ‘buy the dips’ as they come and then plan to sell them off for large gains once the retail investors arrive. #altseason? Nah, we haven't even seen nothin' yet. Once $ETH / $BTC blows the lid on this flag… oof. #ihaveabag pic.twitter.com/rjkWhOSheF — The Crypto Dog📈 (@TheCryptoDog) May 29, 2019  Despite Bitcoin breaking out of its most recent pennant to trade its way up to $9,000, it has since been trading sideways and potentially into a bull-flag formation that is reminiscent of the base it used to spring up from in 2017 – before its year-end parabolic adventure. Unlike Bitcoin however, Ethereum has seen higher highs over the last 24 hours after rallying from its $260 support to now trade at over $280. Litecoin too has smashed through any remaining resistance at $100 to trade up to $120. Traditionally, alt-season usually kicks off with BTC rising first, with money then subsequently flowing downwards through large-cap alt-projects and then into a select group of low market cap ‘decentralised’ projects that only have liquidity with other crypto pairs. Looking at the historical charts for BTC dominance, it’s easy to see that the last time that dominance trended downwards from a similar peak (in December 2017), the move down looked like a parabolic capitulation all the way down to 33%. Chances are we won’t see the same thing play out this time, but if the symbolic 50% dominance fails to hold in the coming weeks, then we may see another shift away from the “It’s only about Bitcoin” narrative that has been building steam in 2019.

1," Bitcoin closed out the week in positive territory, resuming what has been a particularly bullish run since January. Year-to-date Bitcoin has seen just 8 weekly losses, 2 of which came in June. On Sunday, Bitcoin rose by 1.85%, following on from a 2.56% gain on Saturday, to end the day at $11,485. It was a relatively range-bound first half of the day. Bitcoin eased back to a mid-morning intraday low $11,110 before recovering to a late morning high $11,375. The late morning rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 that provided much-needed support through the morning. Falling back from $11,400 levels struck in the middle of the day, Bitcoin slipped through the 23.6% FIB to $11,150 levels before finding support. Bitcoin bounced back to a late intraday high $11,620 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin came up short of the first major resistance level at $11,680.33. For the week, the weekend gains delivered a 6.34% rise for the week ending 7th July. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was green across the board for majors on Sunday. Leading the way on the day were Tron’s TRX and Ethereum, which saw gains of 8.94% and 6.52% respectively. EOS also outperformed Bitcoin on the day, rising by 3.28%. The rest of the pack saw more modest gains. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+1.79%), Ripple’s XRP (+1.81%), Binance Coin (+1.91%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.96%) stood alongside Bitcoin on the day. Litecoin saw the most modest gain of the day, however, rising by 1.71%. For the week, Tron’s TRX led the way, rallying by 10.06% to cement its position in the number 10 spot by market cap. Bucking the trend in the week was Litecoin, which fell by 1.52%. Bitcoin’s dominance held onto 62% levels, having peaked at 63% levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.1%. The total crypto market cap rose from $313.57bn to a high $337.76bn on Thursday before easing back to $330bn levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.39% to $11,440. Moves at the start of the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,547 to a low $11,413. Bitcoin steered clear of the major support and resistance levels early on. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Tron’s TRX bucked the trend early, rising by 0.49% and by 0.29% respectively. The rest of the pack were in the red, with Bitcoin Cash SV leading the way down with a 1.47% loss. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,400 levels to make a move later in the day. A move through the morning high to $11,600 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,700 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Sunday’s high $11,620 and the first major resistance level will likely limit any upside. Failure to hold onto $11,400 levels could see Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. A pullback to $11,200 levels would bring the first major support level at $11,190 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 support levels on the day.

6," Don’t expect unbridled enthusiasm over Facebook’s reported cryptocurrency push just yet. “I don’t believe it’s going to be this kind of major game-changer,” Brent Thill, Jefferies senior technology analyst, tells Yahoo Finance’s “The Ticker.” “We’re still stuck in the way we use the current currencies. And I think anyone that’s shopped on Instagram today realizes using PayPal is pretty easy. You have two clicks of your thumb and you’ve got a product on the way within a day.” According to the Wall Street Journal, the tech giant has support from big names like Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and Uber Technologies (UBER) for the project. Over a dozen companies will reportedly invest roughly $10 million each in an association that will oversee the digital currency, called Libra. This comes as RBC analyst Mark Mahaney forecasts in a recent note that Facebook’s (FB) cryptocurrency strategy could be “one of the most important initiatives in the history of the company to unlock new engagement and revenue streams.” For his part, Thill predicts Facebook backing the digital coin will give it more credibility, but it will take some time for users to adapt. “I think all the internet companies are trying to figure out payments. It’s a huge, huge pain point,” he said. Facebook is planning to unveil its cryptocurrency on Tuesday, according to TechCrunch. McKenzie Stratigopoulos is a producer at Yahoo Finance.

177," Facebook (FB) finally announced its long-awaited cryptocurrency offering Calibra this week, and one Bitcoin (BTC) millionaire thinks it will be huge. The social network on Tuesday officially unveiled Calibra, a cryptocurrency system launching in 2020 that includes a stablecoin called Libra, as well as a digital wallet inside Messenger and WhatsApp that will let users store, send and receive Libra. Pegged to a basket of government-issued currencies to avoid pricing volatility, Libra will launch with at least 29 partners, including Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Uber (UBER), and Spotify (SPOT), and be governed by an independent council. According to 20-year-old Bitcoin millionaire Erik Finman, Calibra is an “amazing” product that will help legitimize cryptocurrency and bring mainstream attention to the overall space. “This is going to be huge for the cryptocurrency space — it’s a huge deal,” says Finman, founder of the bitcoin investing platform CoinBits. “If cryptocurrency wasn’t obvious before, it’s really obvious now. It’s here to stay, and it’s here forever. This isn’t just a project anymore or something that’s in the gallows of the internet.” Finman carved out a reputation among crypto enthusiasts for investing in Bitcoin (BTC) back in 2011 at $12 a coin using $1,000 his grandmother gave him. The 20-year-old’s investment ballooned to $4 million during Bitcoin’s all-time high in 2017, earning him the nickname “the teenaged bitcoin millionaire.” Incidentally, Finman also won a bet with his parents: if he became a crypto millionaire before he turned 18, he could skip college. But as exciting as Calibra sounds, it also raises some “scary” possibilities, Finman adds. “There’s a part of me, again, that says that [Calibra] is great for the credibility of cryptocurrency,” Finman emphasizes. “And while that’s probably the best thing from Mark Zuckerberg’s point of view, it could also be the worst thing depending on how Calibra evolves. Look at all the crazy stuff Facebook’s been doing with your privacy and security.” Besides using Facebook user data towards its sophisticated advertising products, the social network has also come under fire over the last 18 months for incidents regarding user privacy. The Cambridge Analytica scandal from March 2018, for instance, resulted in voting firm Cambridge Analytica gaining access to the information of up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent. Indeed, Facebook anticipates paying a $3 billion to $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission for its privacy lapses. In its white paper published this week, Facebook added that Calibra will be independently governed by the Libra Association Council, based in Geneva. And while the group will serve as the entity through which the Libra Reserve — a reserve of ""financial assets"" for backing Libra — is managed, Finman indicates this more “centralized” model could be used for Facebook’s benefit. After all, Libra will be stored in digital wallets hosted by Facebook-owned services such as Messenger and WhatsApp. “That's very much against the mood in which cryptocurrency was invented, which was, you know, freedom, decentralization, no one to shut it down, and no centralized control,” Finman contends. “The Libra Association and Facebook basically control the development of Calibra. It’s scary, inherently, because it’s run by a massive giant entity, and it’s scary, especially with the reputation Facebook has.” Only time will tell whether Finman’s fears are founded.

There are numerous social media sites used by the cryptocurrency community. While much of the debate tends to take place over on Twitter, Reddit is also one of the main sources for breaking news and discussion of your favourite cryptocurrency topics. Like anything to do with cryptocurrency, controversy is never far away, with accusations of censorship attached to the main Bitcoin subreddit. Here are three cryptocurrency subreddits you should be following. The largest and most popular subreddit – now with over 1 million members – is also the one that has experienced the most controversy. The issue, like most controversies within the Bitcoin community, stems from the scaling debate. Those who advocated for larger blocks felt that their posts were being censored and theories were espoused that the subreddit was under the control of the Bitcoin company Blockstream. This issue highlights a wider problem with online forums. For many people involved in Bitcoin who align themselves with the crypto anarchist ideology, the right to freedom of speech is a key tenant. Therefore, anyone should in theory be allowed to say what they want without fear of being censored. Yet in practice, this can cause issues. Without moderation, a forum can turn into a cesspool of arguments and bickering with little constructive debate. Ultimately, this whole debate led to the creation of r/btc, where Bitcoin Cash is the cryptocurrency of choice. Roger Ver is extremely prominent on this subreddit, and it ascribes to having no form of censorship whatsoever. If you are a Bitcoin fan, then r/Bitcoin is for you, and if you are a Bitcoin Cash fan, then r/btc is where you should head. r/Cryptocurrency is the second-largest cryptocurrency-based subreddit behind r/Bitcoin. Described as the “official source for cryptocurrency news, discussion, and analysis”, any and every cryptocurrency can be discussed on this subreddit. On the subreddit, you will find plenty of links to articles and YouTube videos mixed with bullish and bearish sentiment. With such a large community, and with the vast array of talking points, the subreddit is extremely active. Whereas other subreddits are specific to certain coins, within r/cryptocurrency, all can be discussed freely. Ask me anything (AMA) events are also common with users submitting who they would like to speak to. r/Ethereum is the main subreddit for anyone who has an interest in the Ethereum platform and cryptocurrency. Unlike the Bitcoin community, although there was a fork creating two separate Ethereums, there is a lot less noise surrounding the controversy. With over 430,000 members, you will find the latest Ethereum news and memes. The subreddit also gains legitimacy by having Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as a moderator. Discussion on price is banned as there is another Ethereum subreddit for price chat. The same goes for mining as well. Instead, you will find the latest news on partnerships and what is happening on the ground level with the Ethereum cryptocurrency. The forum is fairly strict in terms of moderation. You may find that your post has to pass through moderation before it appears on the subreddit. This can limit the more controversial topics, but on the other hand, it keeps the subreddit clean and succinct. If you have a particular favourite cryptocurrency, then there is a high chance it will have its own subreddit. How well maintained and active it is depends largely on the community itself. There are dangers to individual subreddits of your favourite cryptocurrencies. Due to their nature, forums can become mere echo chambers where you’ll see plenty of bullish sentiment despite evidence to the contrary, and a severe lack of constructive criticism. The smaller subreddits are less likely to have volunteer moderators, which can mean that debate often spirals out of control or is non-apparent to begin with. The benefits of individual subreddits are that if you are keen on the latest updates, then there is a high chance news will be posted onto these specific subreddits first. Getting to grips with Reddit can take a little time as it has its own unique online culture. The phrase “don’t believe everything you read on the internet” is an apt one when browsing your favourite subreddits. It is often hard to know a person’s motives behind why they say certain things. If you are interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies, then Reddit can definitely be a useful tool for education and debate. Don’t solely rely on Reddit however – try and pool your knowledge from as many sources as possible to gain perspective.

At the recent Malta AI and Blockchain Summit, Coin Rivet caught up with Irina Heaver of Bolton Holding. A lawyer with over 15 years experience in the corporate world, she is now working with many large businesses in the process of tokenisation from her office at the top of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Her entry into the world of blockchain began through IBM bringing blockchain to the shipping world, which convinced her that “blockchain has amazing commercial applications for businesses. I do believe blockchain can bring more to business than just cryptocurrency.” According to Irina, her current employer – Bolton Holding – is “a traditional business”. She states: “We are an alternative investment group. We have real business. We have real assets such as gold and diamond mines. We also do a lot of commodities trading. We invest in financial services. We are building a bank in the UAE. We use a lot of emerging tech.” The emerging technology doesn’t just stop at blockchain though. “We also implement machine learning and AI in our operations,” she enthuses. The main aim of Bolton Holding as a traditional business is “to bring more value to our shareholders and investors”. During our chat, the most fascinating prospect Irina discussed is the potential tokenisation of one of the world’s biggest football clubs. “We are looking at a certain major club. They asked us to get involved and we are looking at how we can bring value not only for the shareholders and the players, but also the community. The beauty of tokenisation is creating the community and creating the benefits for the community,” says Irina. But how would this work exactly? “Imagine a tokenomics model where as a fan you get rewarded for good behaviour and punished for bad behaviour. If you get rewarded with the token of the club, this could give you an opportunity to meet your favourite player or to be invited to the next event. It’s a very interesting proposition we are working on, but it’s a bit early to say. Watch that space!” Although Irina didn’t specify which club it is she’s working with just yet, she did drop some hints in the video interview, which will be on Coin Rivet’s YouTube page shortly. While we often hear of how cryptocurrency and blockchain is progressing in the Western world and how it can help citizens in states such as Venezuela, the Middle East largely goes unnoticed, despite the popularity of the technology in the region. Irina notes: “We have a huge scene there. We have a blockchain centre and cryptocurrency meet-ups. We also work with banks educating employees on what cryptocurrency is. What I do is very simple. I will grab your phone and install a wallet and send you $5 of Bitcoin to show you how easy it is. Then they call back and ask how we can get more and ask more. It is an educational process.” The process of tokenising many large businesses, including a major football club, is a fascinating proposition. Whilst many in the cryptocurrency scene view Bitcoin as a harbinger of death for traditional business and banks, Irina is instead helping these corporations modernise with the times.

Ethereum developer hopes to see more women in blockchain," Coin Rivet recently had the pleasure of catching up with Ethereum smart contracts developer Alice Henshaw. Alice spoke candidly to us about her love for computer security, the pitfalls of the private securities market, and motivating more women to enter the intimidating space of blockchain development. Could you tell us a bit about your own personal journey as a blockchain developer? I have been involved in the blockchain space for just over three years now in various ways. Currently, I am a blockchain developer focusing on development on the Ethereum blockchain, which I’ve been doing for the last 18 months or so. I am currently working for Fluidity (fluidity.io), where my day-to-day role involves developing smart contracts for Decentralised Finance (DeFi), alongside some research. Smart contracts are essentially programs which can be deployed onto certain blockchains, which are then executed in a decentralised way. What drew you into working on smart contracts? I started studying computer science and development at the age of 16, and immediately my favourite area was that of cryptography and security. At university, I studied computer science and chose a number of modules that focused on computer security. From there, smart contracts seemed like a natural progression for me. As a smart contract developer, you have to focus on the security of your contracts every single day – by publishing programs in such a public and decentralised way, and often using them to manage money, you’re almost asking people to try to hack them. This element of critical security brings together my love for computer security and blockchain. Currently it seems as though you are working on the tokenisation of securities. Why is this an important area to tackle? Blockchain provides a simple way to implement ownership and transferral of assets – much as you can transfer Bitcoins between individuals, you could transfer shares from one person to another. The current, traditional private securities markets are implemented in such a way that private securities are illiquid, inefficient, and inaccessible to the average investor. Tokenising these securities allows us to automate and massively simplify a number of the traditional processes, which ultimately has the potential to fix a number of issues. However, security tokens are still subject to the same regulations as traditional securities, meaning that all regulatory requirements must be outlined and implemented before any security can be tokenised. We are fast approaching a point where tokens are being created for just about anything, even if they do not serve a real purpose. From a developer’s point of view, how can we remedy this trend and ensure only tokens with real purpose, use cases, and value are created? Due to the nature of blockchain, there’s nothing that can be done to prevent the creation of these tokens – it’s incredibly easy to deploy a new token contract to Ethereum. The fact that we cannot prevent useless tokens being created means that they need to instead be identified and called out by the community, thereby deterring people from purchasing the token. This is happening more and more as users are becoming educated on what a good token model looks like. However, there’s certainly still work to do. I’m a strong advocate of helping the blockchain community be more diverse. As is true with technology in general, there are a small number of women working in the space. Last year, I ran workshops on Solidity development particularly aimed at women in the hopes that I can motivate them to enter this somewhat intimidating space and to help them do so with the confidence to voice their opinions and ensure they are heard.

Circle K adds Bitcoin ATMs to 20 convenience stores," US-based crypto venture DigitalMint has teamed with convenience store chain, Circle K, installing 20 Bitcoin ATMs across Arizona and Nevada as part of a pilot programme. “We are thrilled to be partnering with a respected organisation like Circle K,” says Marc Grens, President and Co-Founder, DigitalMint. “This opens the door for massive expansion of Bitcoin access to new markets around the globe.” Customers can buy up to $20,000 in Bitcoin per day. DigitalMint charges 12% of a transaction, although rate reductions are available. The Arizona ATMs are located in Phoenix, Mesa, Tempe, Tucson, Flagstaff, Surprise, Maricopa and Nevada ATMs in Las Vegas. DigitalMint says that the partnership makes it the largest Bitcoin ATM and PoS operator in the US. It currently has over 250 locations in 25 states. Joel Konicke, Category Manager, Circle K Stores, comments: “Partnering with DigitalMint allows us to provide our customers with seamless access to Bitcoin, at a very reasonable price.” The first Bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver during 2013. But now the Mayor of the Canadian city is now proposing a ban on the machines, arguing that they open the door to money laundering. It’s important to remember who exactly is using them; some of these people are often on society’s fringes, especially sex workers. Vancouver’s potential ban on such machines will affect that vulnerable group disproportionately, argues Ethan Lou, a former journalist who these days runs a mining company in Canada and whose first book, Once a Bitcoin Miner, will be published next year. In an article for The Globe and Mail, he says: “Make no mistake, the issue of Bitcoin ATMs is one of social class. Sex workers use cryptocurrency to buy ads or run websites because credit card issuers often refuse to work with the platforms and hosting services that cater to their industry. Using cryptocurrency also grants a certain anonymity, which is of particular importance; many sex workers deliberately avoid using online exchange platforms, which have lower fees, but often require bank accounts, credit cards, a fixed address or other identification.” What makes the ATMs attractive to sex workers is also attractive to money launderers, Lou concedes. “British Columbia has wide-ranging issues with dirty money and it is not a stretch to say the ATMs could be involved. But cleaning ill-gotten gains is almost as old as sex work. Are Bitcoin ATMs used more so than, or even as frequently as, restaurants, casinos, convenience stores or any other business?” Ultimately, those who launder money might end up little affected, he argues. With the right will and means, it is not hard to buy Bitcoin anonymously for cheaper than through ATMs. “As the City of Vancouver goes about its research, it is incumbent upon staff to at least consult the sex workers who, through no fault of their own, are caught in someone else’s fight, potentially made to suffer from someone else’s sins,” Lou concludes.

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 26/06/19," Bitcoin rallied by 6.03% on Tuesday. Following on from a 1.47% gain from Monday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,737.00. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $11,028.0 to a high $11,519.0. Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $11,283.33 and second major resistance level at $11,497.67. A late morning sell-off saw Bitcoin slide to an intraday low $10,802.0 before finding support. Steering clear of the first major support level at $10,707.33, Bitcoin rallied to a late intraday high and new swing hi $11,780. Bitcoin broke back through the first major resistance level at $11,283.33 and second major resistance level at $11,497.67. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed bag for the rest of the pack. Joining Bitcoin in the green on the day were Ethereum and Litecoin, with gains of 1.8% and 0.13% respectively. It was red for the rest of the top 10. Leading the way down were Binance Coin and Stellar’s Lumen. The pair fell by 4.4% and 3.5% respectively. EOS and Ripple’s XRP fell by 1.87% and 1.81%, while Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash SV fell by just 0.63% and 0.17% respectively. The moves through Tuesday saw Bitcoin’s dominance break through to 60% levels for the first time since April 2017. Bitcoin also drove the total crypto market cap to $336.68bn on the day, up from $330.43bn on Monday. In spite of the Bitcoin rally, 24-hour trading volumes held relatively steady, rising from $70.15bn to $71.9bn levels on the day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 6.1% to $12,453.0. A particularly bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rally from a morning low $11,684.5 to a high $12,945.0. The early morning rally saw Bitcoin break through the first major resistance level at $12,077.33 and second resistance level at $12,417.67. From the rest of the top 10, Litecoin and EOS struggled through the morning. At the time of writing, the pair were down by 1% and by 0.12% respectively. It was bullish for the rest of the pack. Coming in a distant second behind Bitcoin was Ethereum, which was up by 3.74%. Stellar’s Lumen also found support, rising by 2.2%, with Binance Coin up by 1.22%. The broad-based crypto rally added $25bn to the total market cap, with the market cap sitting at $361.25bn. Trading volumes were also up from $72bn levels to $94bn levels. Bitcoin would need to hold above the second major resistance level at $12,417.67 to support another run at $13,000 levels. While we can expect Bitcoin to face plenty of resistance at $13,000 levels, Bitcoin could take a run at the third major resistance level at $13,395.67. Bitcoin would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high $12,945.0. Failure to hold above the second major resistance level at $12,417.67 could see Bitcoin give up some of the morning gains. A pullback through to $12,300 levels could see Bitcoin fall back through the first major resistance level at $12,077.33. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should avoid a return to sub-$12,000 levels on the day.

It seems that every few years or so, new technologies enter the hype cycle and are touted as the next big game changer. Around 10 years ago it was 3D printing. Then, with the creation of Bitcoin, hype emerged regarding the underlying blockchain technology. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) has taken some of that spotlight and has joined the hype train. Blockchain and artificial intelligence could connect the world of the future through the Internet of Things. It is argued that we are currently in the midst of a fourth Industrial Revolution thanks to the advances in technology. Blockchain is just one part of this, and so is artificial intelligence. AI arguably has the potential to remove the necessity for many of the jobs in today’s society. Such arguments have been made by both left-wing and right-wing commentators such as David Graeber and his “bullsh*t jobs” argument. Dr Ben Goertzel, CEO of Singularity, recently spoke to my colleague Jordan Heal, and much of what they discussed regarding AI has many crossovers with blockchain technology, namely decentralisation. Goertzel stated Singularity “should be a decentralised protocol owned by everyone and no-one”. This follows a similar ideology to blockchains. If a blockchain is centralised, then the use case is null and void. Blockchain is sometimes referred to as a slow, inefficient database. While this has an element of truth, there are many projects that are attempting to harness blockchain for economic means such as Bitcoin, and others that store data on the blockchain. Two projects with such aims include Siacoin and Storj. With centralised entities storing their data on a database, there is always the risk of being hacked no matter how high quality your security is. Run a search on Google for data breaches and you’ll see many large companies have been affected with personal data being leaked. By storing this data on a blockchain, it should be theoretically possible to discourage attackers as blockchains prove much harder to hack provided they have enough hashing power. Under a decentralised storage system, AI could then analyse the data, thereby improving its own knowledge for the benefit of us. Currently, having so much data stored on a database benefits companies such as Facebook who can then use that data to build a picture of its users to target them with advertising. Both blockchain and artificial intelligence can have anarchist underpinnings of decentralisation, returning power to the community instead of a centralised corporation. Should AI truly take hold as Dr Ben Goertzel argues, then with many jobs becoming obsolete, it may necessitate a new economic paradigm and a change of mentality from both the state and its citizens. Whether Bitcoin or blockchain technology can be helpful in this regard is still being debated today. Commentator and podcaster Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano has recently argued that Bitcoin could help solve the inequality that is currently prevalent in the United States. Were Graeber’s and Goertzel’s ideas to come to fruition, with the job market losing so many jobs, this income equality could be heightened. Pomp argues that Bitcoin can solve this issue. New technologies bring with them a lot of hype and promise, but it is possible for them to change the way human society functions. The computer changed the way we work and led to the creation of the internet, which allowed us all to become more connected, for good and for bad. Mobile phones have only added to this sense of connectedness. It is clear that new technologies can be revolutionary. Despite both blockchain and AI being talked about as possible game changers, it is too early to guarantee this. Until we can verify their use case through real-world applications, we cannot trust those that are promising us the world. With that being said, both blockchain and AI seem to be entering an almost symbiotic partnership of decentralisation, attempting to revolutionise the way that we as citizens will interact with our governments, each other, and the world.

"Market Morning: Gold Awakens, More Iran Sanctions, Bitcoin Breaks Through, McDonald’s Goes Robots"," Gold Wakes Up, Media Wakes Up To Gold Gold (NYSEARCA:GLD) is on the move, now above $1,400 an ounce for the first time since August 2013. Mainstream media is starting to pay more attention to the metal now, but still seems to keep to the basic script that gold goes up in times of uncertainty. “Gold has historically been a pocket of strength in periods where uncertainty increases sharply,” said CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell, quoted by CNN. Investors often flock to gold as a safe haven in times of increased volatility, CNN explains. The problem with these explanations are that they are simply untrue, but nobody seems to challenge them. The vast majority of the last bull market in gold, which began in 2001, occurred during the 2002-2007 bull market in stocks. This was not a period of volatility or uncertainty. Gold quadrupled over the time period from 2001 to 2008 after breaching $1,000 for the first time ever. It has now been basing for 10 years, after retracing a little less than 50% of its previous bull market. Trump Administration Rescue Iran From Trade Imbalances…Through Sanctions Meanwhile, the Trump Administration is looking to support the gold price, and help balance Iranian international trade. After calling off a military strike against Iran over the weekend and for some reason publicizing this story, President Trump has instead decided to increase economic sanctions against Iran, which probably won’t make them any happier or willing to cooperate with whatever Trump wants them to cooperate about.  The sanctions path, apparently is called the “diplomatic path” even though sanctions mean ringing a country and preventing imports from crossing, sort of like tariffs except it’s a move against another country rather than your own country. In that sense, perhaps Trump is trying to help Iran by balancing its trade deficit through sanctions. Meanwhile, Iran is already undergoing hyperinflation, with an annual inflation rate of 52%. OPEC Meet Next Week Critical for Oil Prices The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is meeting next week in what could help determine oil’s (NYSEARCA:USO) trajectory over the next few months. The cartel is aware that the world is expecting them to uphold the current production cut structure and perhaps even clamp down the pumps even harder as the Saudis try to prop up the oil price in preparation for yet another IPO attempt for Saudi Aramco, the most profitable company in the world, but not profitable enough for the appetites of Mohamed Bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. Arguments could be made either way regarding the bullishness or bearishness of the continued trade war between the US and China on oil prices, bullish because it should push up consumer price inflation, which tends to bring oil prices up, and bearish because a weaker economy could push down the demand for oil. The dollar’s direction (NYSEARCA:UUP) should help determine which way oil is going to go assuming that OPEC keeps up with market expectations. Bitcoin Bear Market Rally Continues Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) bear market rally continues over this weekend with prices breaching the $11,000 mark, and Ethereum (ETH-USD) breaching $300 for the first time in about a year. Trading volume in Ethereum and Bitcoin have reached all time highs since the current rally began last December. The next resistance zone for Bitcoin is around $11,500, and after that, there is no significant resistance until about $17,500, and then all time highs. So far though, this continues to be a bear market rally, until new highs are breached. McDonald’s Battles Minimum Wage With robots. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) branches in Chicago are testing out the ability of automatic fryers and voice activated drive-throughs  to take over from people, to, in their words “help increase production and shorten wait times” when in reality, it’s probably spurred on by higher minimum wage legislation and McDonald’s is trying primarily to save money. Employees are staring walkouts over these things, claiming that robots are going to take their jobs, which only becomes more probable if they walk out, as robots don’t have the ability to do this, making them easier to manage. Watch out for new legislation against automation, which, if it were a road taken in the 19th century, would have outlawed the industrial revolution, meaning many of these people now walking out of their jobs would never have existed in the first place.   The post Market Morning: Gold Awakens, More Iran Sanctions, Bitcoin Breaks Through, McDonald’s Goes Robots appeared first on Market Exclusive.",ME Staff,Market Exclusive,2019-06-24T11:00:19.000Z

May 31st — Button Wallet, the Venmo app for cryptocurrency, today announced US customers can use fiat currency to quickly and securely buy digital assets, making Button the first company or bot to enable users to buy-in with fiat on Telegram. Button’s multi-currency crypto wallet is built and comes pre-installed on Telegram messenger. The fiat capability, which makes crypto even more accessible to a larger swath of the population, has been made possible by implementing Wyre technology in a way that has never been done before. Previously, purchasing crypto was confused and time-consuming; it could take up to three weeks for a new user to be verified to purchase crypto with fiat within the US. With the integration of Wyre into Button Wallet, users in the US can become verified to purchase cryptocurrency with a debit card usually within one hour. “Since launching last year, we rapidly gained over 100,000 users; users who rely on Button Wallet to quickly and easily make payments and split finances using cryptocurrencies,” says Alex Safonov, CEO of Button Wallet. “Letting users buy-in with fiat just as quickly and easily will only make crypto even more appealing and accessible for more people. They will be able to trade BTC, BCH, ETH, ETC, LTC, Waves, Dai and ERC-20 tokens without external fees, and will be able to pay friends and clients alike for everything from freelance gigs to split Coachella expenses.” The addition of Wyre is particularly advantageous to TON investors, as anticipation for the release of TON (Telegram Open Network) grows. Telegram Group recently raised $1.7 billion from private investors to build TON. TON’s cryptocurrency, Gram, will be integrated into Button’s wallet during the third quarter. The Button team has also worked hard to blend Telegram’s KYC process, Telegram Passport, into its ecosystem, making it as simple as possible for users while remaining compliant. Once users create their KYC within Telegram Passport, they don’t need to do it again for any other applications or bots within Telegram. Button is also the only Telegram wallet that doesn’t store user info, passwords, or QR codes. “90% of crypto holders have used Telegram, and Button already created a wallet and exchange right where they are, without requiring external software,” says Rachael McCrary, CCO of Button Wallet. “Now, more Telegram users will be able to get in the game. Once users can buy-in with fiat currency, there are endless possibilities: have a friend pay you in Ethereum and exchange it for Bitcoin, tip someone simply by finding their username in Telegram, and more.” Button, which is based in Moscow and Los Angeles, was developed by a team of hackers who have won countless hackathons around the globe. The Button team was part of the most recent cohort of the Silicon Valley incubator ETC Labs and graduated from accelerators MIT Play Labs and StartupBoost LA. The team has also won 15 engineering awards and hackathons, including ETHSanFrancisco, ETHSingapore and ETHDenver, where they received five nominations (more than any other company). Last week, they attended Consensus and ETHNewYork, winning hacker nominations at the latter from Binance, Matic, and Wyre.

8," Bitcoin took a massive tumble tonight as the celebrated high of $13,880 and a remarkable push towards $14k collapsed in a heap at $12,400. The sudden dump coincided with Coinbase going down following rumours that a $100m transaction into the San Francisco-based exchange was taking place. After starting the week with impressive momentum following Sunday’s successful punch through $10,000, BTC had been attracting a lot of attention as it began a strong ascent. Reaching out to the underside of $14,000, it had analysts across the globe tipping the original cryptocurrency to quickly lurch for almost unimaginable figures like $20k over the next few days. However, unconfirmed news that 8,884 Bitcoins were on the move to Coinbase coincided with what became one of the sharpest drops in the crypto’s ten-year history. Social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit were awash with all manner of unfounded rumours and conspiracy theories about Coinbase and its connection to BTC’s price. Earlier today, though, Coinbase did notify users via Twitter that some important scheduled maintenance work to its website would be taking place, backing up the suggestion that its going offline was purely coincidental at the time of Bitcoin’s dramatic plunge. At the time of going to press, BTC had arrested its freefall somewhat at around $12,500. Did deVere Group’s Nigel Green predict the recent BTC rise?

"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 25/06/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC rose by 1.52% on Monday. Reversing a 1.67% fall from Sunday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $477.25. A start of a day intraday low $460.78 saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall through the first major support level at $463.63 before finding support. Bitcoin Cash ABC rose to late morning high $476.5 before falling back to $465 levels and into the red. Support from the broader market kicked in late in the day, leading to an intraday high $477.25 at the day end. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 0.79% to $481.00. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall to a morning low $473.58 before finding support. Steering clear of the first major support level at $466.26, Bitcoin Cash ABC struck a morning high $482.46 before easing back. The first major resistance level at $482.74 pinned Bitcoin Cash ABC back early on. For the day ahead, a move back through the first major resistance level would support a run at the second major resistance level at $488.23. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from $482 levels. Failure to move back through the first major resistance level could see Bitcoin Cash ABC pullback to sub-$480 levels. A fall through $471 levels would bring the first major support level at $466.27 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$460 levels. Litecoin fell by 1.02% on Monday. Following on from a 3.34% slide on Sunday, Litecoin ended the day at $135.26. A bearish start to the day saw Litecoin fall from an intraday high $136.66 to an early morning low $133.21. Litecoin fell through the first major support level at $133.84 before recovering to $136 levels. A second pullback in the late afternoon saw Litecoin slide back through the first major support level to an intraday low $132.13. Steering clear of the second major support level at $131.02, Litecoin managed to limit the losses on the day, with a move back through to $135 levels. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 0.58% to $136.04. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin rise to a morning high $136.8 before easing back. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $137.24, Litecoin fell to a morning low $134.86 before finding support. Litecoin left the major support levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold onto $135 levels through the morning would support another run at the first major resistance level at $137.24. For the bulls, Litecoin would need a broad-based crypto rally, however, to bring $137 levels into play. Failure to hold onto $135 levels could see Litecoin see red for a 3rd consecutive day. A fall through $134.6 levels would bring the first major support level at $132.71 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Litecoin should steer clear of the second major support level at $130.15 and sub-$130 levels. Ripple’s XRP rose by 0.76% on Monday. Partially reversing a 1.5% fall from Sunday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.47402. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from a morning high $0.47046 to an early intraday low $0.44627. Ripple’s XRP slid through the first major support level at $0.4595 and second major support level at $0.4482 before finding support. Ripple’s XRP recovered to $0.46 levels and a relatively range-bound afternoon. A late rally saw Ripple’s XRP move through to $0.47 levels and strike an intraday high $0.47627 to avoid red on the day. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 0.39% to $0.47215. A choppy start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rise to a morning high $0.47778 before hitting reverse. Coming up short of the first major resistance level at $0.4809, Ripple’s XRP fell to a morning low $0.46762 before finding support. Ripple’s XRP left the major support levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold onto $0.47 levels through the morning would support another run at the first major resistance level at $0.4809. Ripple’s XRP would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $0.47 levels. In the event of a crypto rally, the second major resistance level at $0.4878 could come into play before any pullback. Failure to hold onto $0.47 levels could see Ripple’s XRP test the first major support level at $0.4567 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ripple’s XRP would likely steer clear of sub-$0.44 support levels on the day.

How to win a free Bitcoin," Browse the internet and you will see numerous sites and opportunities to win a free Bitcoin. However, it is unlikely that any of them are real. They are most likely scams trying to steal your money by offering you the chance of further riches. For those who perhaps missed out on the cheaper cost of Bitcoin and want to gain a holding without purchasing it directly, then trying to get free Bitcoin can be very tempting.

Browse the internet and you will see numerous sites and opportunities to win a free Bitcoin. However, it is unlikely that any of them are real. They are most likely scams trying to steal your money by offering you the chance of further riches. For those who perhaps missed out on the cheaper cost of Bitcoin and want to gain a holding without purchasing it directly, then trying to get free Bitcoin can be very tempting. Let’s have a look and see whether there are any legitimate chances to win a free Bitcoin on the world wide web. A legitimate chance to win a free Bitcoin took place on this very website as a promotion to celebrate its launch. The competition ran from October 2018 to January 2019, with the only entry requirement being to fill out a simple form. In the world of distrust that is cryptocurrencies, there was plenty of healthy scepticism around this competition. However, a winner was announced in January who was then invited to visit the Coin Rivet office to receive their prize. You can see the winner being announced here on our YouTube channel, along with their visit to our office, with CEO Sheba Karamat carrying out the handover duties. Were you to type “free Bitcoin” into Google, you will find a plethora of options. The legitimacy of most should be questioned, however. Many of the top results refer you to Bitcoin faucets. Faucets work as a reward system for users completing menial tasks such as filling in Captchas. While it is possible to earn free Bitcoin by completing these tasks, the payouts are such that you are only ever likely to receive a few satoshis in return for your time and effort. The profit from these websites is usually made through the variety of adverts they run. If you want to learn about Bitcoin and play around with very small amounts, then this might not be the worst introduction to the world of cryptocurrencies. A safer and more legitimate method of winning free Bitcoin is to provide a service to the community. The service can be anything you choose, be it helping with development, providing artwork, or merely being funny. Many members of Twitter or Reddit provide their Bitcoin wallet address for anyone who would like to tip them for the services they provide. Through this method, and if you are successful enough, you might find yourself earning some free Bitcoin or other form of cryptocurrency. If you are a risk-taker by nature, then gambling could be a potential method to win yourself some free Bitcoin. There are of course many risks to gambling – the casino always wins as they say. But there are now numerous cryptocurrency gambling websites that claim to offer fair chances of winning. If you strike it lucky, you may find yourself the proud owner of many more Bitcoin, but don’t ever bet more than you are willing to lose. Cloud mining is one method many people have used to earn themselves free Bitcoin. Through this, users provide capital upfront and are supposed to be rewarded with a cut of the mining profits of the pool. Most cloud mining platforms offer reward referral schemes as well. Yet for many of these sites, this is the actual income revenue that is then distributed, with little to no mining actually taking place. In essence, they become large pyramid schemes through these referral programs that continue to pay out to old users. Unfortunately, like many pyramid schemes, when there are no new users, they then collapse. It would be a wise move to steer clear of such websites. Famously, there used to be a number of Ethereum scam giveaway bots on Twitter that would latch onto famous Twitter personalities and offer free cryptocurrency. The only catch was that you had to send some first in order to receive more back. These scams became extremely popular and ultimately profitable for those running them. Should Bitcoin rocket in price, then expect to see a return of such schemes. If anyone or any website offers to give you free cryptocurrency in return for sending them some first, you may as well assume it is a scam. There are not many legitimate competitions to win a free Bitcoin, but it is possible there are some out there (as Coin Rivet showed). Always ensure you complete your own due diligence and verify the trustworthiness of anyone offering free Bitcoin. If you need to provide capital upfront to have a chance of winning, then it is likely to be a scam. As always, stay safe out there!

1," Apart from being a censorship-resistant store of value, Bitcoin’s main use case is trading. What most people, including the media, don’t understand is that’s not inherently a bad thing.  Bitcoin’s economic activity continues to be dominated by trading on exchanges. Why? Because as opposed to the traditional finance, the cryptocurrency markets never close, they are lightly regulated and volatile. Moreover, the prices are often not driven by fundamentals, which makes it an attractive target for day-traders who analyze, buy, and sell demand on the book alongside technical analysis. High volatility levels have not only attracted day-traders but also motivated a number of high-frequency trading firms to enter the cryptocurrency market.

Binance launches bitcoin-pegged token on Binance Chain," Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume, is issuing a bitcoin-backed token, the firm announced in a blog post on Monday. Named BTCB, the tokens are reportedly 100% backed by bitcoins held in a reserve address, and will be issued by the exchange's native blockchain network, Binance Chain. BTCB's launch is part of a larger move by the exchange to boost the selection of tokens available for trading on Binance DEX, Binance's recently-launched decentralized exchange. BTCBs will be available for trading via a BTCB/BTC trading pair on Binance's main platform, and can then be transferred to Binance DEX for trading. ""With the increase in the selection of tokens available on Binance DEX, there should be an increase in trading volume and liquidity, This would further increase the utility value of Binance DEX,"" the firm stated. There are plans to have multiple crypto-pegged tokens in the future.",Steven Zheng,The Block,2019-06-17T13:53:24.000Z
Latest Bitcoin price and analysis (BTC to USD)," At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading just above $11,450 after price crashed close to 23% from $13,800 to $10,500 during the previous week. It seems the hypothesis that weekends are good for Bitcoin may not always be true, even though the price is now higher than it was one week ago as BTC consolidated above the key $11,000 level on Sunday. Will Bitcoin push higher during the week? Or will we see more major retracements back to the $10,000 region? Bitcoin is evolving as expected. Its overall value keeps increasing, and if you look at the volumes profile on the left of the graph above, you’ll notice there’s plenty of volume keeping BTC above the critical $11,000 level. My prediction that Bitcoin could hit $20,000 by the end of the year could turn into an “end of the month” kind of deal. Assuming the positive trend continues and BTC price continues to rise, we should expect higher volumes coming in at key levels close to $20,000. Although many retail investors will be looking to sell some of their gains when Bitcoin hits all-time highs again, we can expect the price to keep going at least for a few weeks. However, as the market becomes more liquid, we should expect fewer violent swings, so it could take longer for BTC to reach a new high. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal – not only in shorter time frames but also in daily and weekly ones as well – I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past two weeks, volume has gone from $17 billion to $23 billion, consolidating now around $20 billion. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $15,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Of course, if you think I might be overreacting to positive news, you can always check what other expert analysts have to say about this recent price movement. Hopefully, the market will continue this positive momentum. Pay attention to retracements back down towards the 200-day EMA to make new entries. Safe trades!

"Bitcoin momentarily crests $9,000 for the first time in a year"," Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, briefly broke the $9,000 resistance level Thursday afternoon the first time since May 2018.  Soon after the cryptocurrency broke through $9,000, it shed $500 as per data provided by crypto exchange Coinbase. At last check, it was trading at $8,573 per coin. The volatile asset has been on a tear since the beginning of the year, nearly tripling in value from its bottom below $3,200 at the end of 2018. It's not exactly clear what has been behind bitcoin's impressive price action. Still, there have been some positive signs, including the entrance of larger players into the market, such as Fidelity and Intercontinental Exchange.  Options trading suggest the price of bitcoin could surge even higher.

Yet outside of the United States, most of the world’s population is not invested in financial assets or markets due to issues of access and affordability, ” says Bill Barhydt, CEO and founder of Abra. “Abra is addressing this global inequality by allowing more people to have a stake in financial markets. The focus of this launch is to make financial markets of the developed world more accessible and affordable to those in emerging economies.”  $5 minimums and $0 trading fees for 2019 Abra makes investing in stocks affordable for everyone with a fractionalized investment model and $5 minimum per investment. Just as investors can own a fraction of a bitcoin, they can now use Abra to own fractions of high-priced stocks and ETFs. As a special launch promotion, Abra will be offering $0 trading fees for the rest of 2019 on stock and ETF investments.  More than 50 stocks and ETFs available Starting today, investors outside of the United States can fractionally invest in more than 50 stock and ETF products, including: – Popular stocks like Tesla, Uber, Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix, and Berkshire Hathaway. – Commodities such as SPDR Gold Trust and oil. – Indexes including Vanguard Growth, the S&P 500, Real Estate, and the Russell 2000. – International markets including Asia, Australia, Mexico, and Emerging Markets index funds. “We’re thrilled to unveil the world’s first global investment app to those individuals who have been traditionally shut out of investing in financial markets,” says Willie Wang, VP of product at Abra. “Tens of thousands of investors from around the globe signed up for the waitlist to access this revolutionary new product.

This means the funds are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, making the transactions more secure and private than centralised databases used by most crypto exchanges and wallets.  Abra is built this way on the belief that a non-custodial wallet is a fundamental right and the cornerstone to a new decentralised financial system. Decentralised alternatives to the traditional financial system hold the promise of universal access to financial services and products, like the ability for anyone, anywhere to have the same public market investing opportunities.

"First $10k, then $11k as Bitcoin enjoys super Saturday"," After breaking $10,000 for the first time in over a year, Bitcoin has now sped past the $11k mark, according to Coin360. Trading #Bitcoin – FOMO is Upon Us, $10k Gone in Blink of an Eye… Now at $11k… What do Charts Say… & should have Q&A time from @PorcFest https://t.co/4dbbCRLcUc — Tone Vays [#UnderstandBit] (@ToneVays) June 22, 2019  At the time of writing, it is up 12.81% on the day and trading at $11,063. And it gets better…’FOMO’ could take Bitcoin from $9,000 to $20,000 within months, Fundstrat Global Advisors Co-founder Tom Lee told CNBC this week. “I think it is easily going to take out its all time highs,” he declared. Not everyone is getting out the party balloons and champagne, however. “I’m still not sold on the idea that it’s up, up, up from here,” says Simon Peters, Analyst at eToro. “We’re due a significant correction still and prices could fall back to as low as $6,500 before the next major rise. That said, you can’t ignore the continuing price surge we’ve seen this year.” As for the latest rise, global politics could be one reason, Peters reckons. “It’s busy out there with the US-China trade war rumbling on, a new Prime Minister on the way in Britain and protests in Hong Kong. Some investors will naturally be spooked and are seeking a safe haven in assets like crypto. Bitcoin’s price may have also been boosted by Tether ‘printing’ another $150 million, which has historically been associated with a bump in crypto prices,” he concludes. George McDonaugh, CEO and Co-Founder of KR1, also advises caution, “On the long way up to $20,000 there were five moments where there was a 40% decrease in price. These shake-outs test your staying power and many new entrants will hand their precious coins back to the market,” he says. “We will see huge corrections again, and passing 10k may well be the catalyst that drives us back down, but whatever happens, we’ve been clearly shown that the interest, adoption and money has not in any way left this new asset class.” The post First $10k, then $11k as Bitcoin enjoys super Saturday appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Scott Thompson,Coin Rivet,2019-06-22T13:00:55.000Z
Facebook's cryptocurrency Libra aims to 'put the currency back in cryptocurrency'," Libra, the Facebook-supported cryptocurrency coming in 2020, has very ambitious plans and, already, vociferous critics. Facebook on Tuesday announced dual crypto ventures coming in 2020: Libra, a cryptocurrency that will be governed by the Libra Association, an “independent” consortium of 28 “founding members”; and Calibra, a Facebook subsidiary that will offer a digital wallet app for storing and sending Libra. While the “founding members” of Libra include some very big names in payments and commerce—like Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, Coinbase, and eBay—many still see the entire project as a Facebook venture, considering the simultaneously coordinated announcements and that Facebook executive David Marcus oversaw the Libra launch. But the Libra Association’s head of policy Dante Disparte, in an appearance with Yahoo Finance’s live show YFi AM, says that all of the founding members are buying in to an ambitious plan aimed at “universal adoption” of Libra. “I think there’s a clear, common connection among all the founding partners,” he says. “At one level, it’s a big moment for digital assets and cryptocurrencies generally, which is that they would be accepted with near universal adoption given those types of networks... also a commitment among the founding members to really drive a wedge on issues of financial inclusion and opportunity.” That sounds like a pretty grand plan for a digital coin that cryptocurrency devotees are already widely dismissing as not truly decentralized (since it’s overseen by a roundtable of companies that have each agreed to invest a minimum of $10 million) and running on a blockchain that is not truly “permissionless.”   Just so we are clear, Libra is:- not decentralized- not censorship resistant- not guaranteed to work technologically - not guaranteed to be cleared by regulators- not clear in regards to tax implications On the other hand, one of the biggest criticisms mainstream financial giants and Wall Street folks have had about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they still don’t really function as cryptocurrencies—and indeed, even their biggest flag-wavers have shifted to hyping their use as stores of value, rather than actual daily currencies to spend. Libra, Disparte says, aims “first and foremost to put the term ‘currency’ back in cryptocurrency. It really is designed to be a unit of purchase and a unit of daily transactions, as opposed to a speculative asset—which is, candidly, where many cryptocurrencies have stood. And they’ve done well in that class if you’re interested in volatility. Libra, as an asset, is really meant to serve daily needs.”   It’s hard to launch a project that is criticized by both governments and decentralized crypto.Congrats on the launch, Libra! As for the questions around whether Libra can truly be seen as an independent cryptocurrency, Disparte counters: “I would say that from a structural point of view, this is a fairly enlightened moment on many levels. We have 28 founding members in this organization; it’s independent; the technology itself, while incubated initially at Facebook, is being set up as an open-source technology... The association itself is very much independently structured and governed.” There’s a key part there: the technology was incubated at Facebook – Facebook execs oversaw the rollout. But eventually, when the Libra blockchain launches, it aims to have 100 founding members, with no one member having more than 1% say in the governance. With that stated plan, Libra will aim to win over both the cryptocurrency skeptics and the cryptocurrency believers who are Libra skeptics. Lawmakers and politicians aren’t convinced: a handful came out immediately against the launch, using Libra as a punching bag to call for heightened regulation of Facebook.

In February this year, cryptocurrencies' market cap hit a 21-month low. However, by the end of May, its value had more than doubled and has continued growing since. The ongoing clarification of regulatory frameworks may have contributed to the rising prices of cryptocurrencies, the report suggests. Similarly, the renewed attention from institutional investors and established companies may have also affected the market positively. According to the report, there have been more than 250 token offerings this year, raising a total of $3.3 billion; with Bitfinex’s IEO topping the table. “The development of IEOs has accelerated significantly since the beginning of 2019,” noted Dr. Daniel Diemers, Head of Blockchain EMEA at PwC. “It reflects the creativity and innovative spirit of the crypto industry and shows that the demand for simple and secure solutions is growing. IEOs show that fundraising via cryptocurrencies is becoming more established and striving for greater institutionalization and credibility.”",Carol Gaszcz,The Block,2019-06-27T08:48:46.000Z
"Bitcoin hits $10,000 and heads for all time highs"," Bitcoin has broken $10,000 for the first time in over a year, according to Coin360. Kudos to regular Coin Rivet contributor Jon Walsh for calling this one in early June. Call me mental, but I can feel a sharp parabolic style price increase to $10k for BTC in the next four weeks. Let’s see… — Jon Walsh (@walshjonwalsh) June 4, 2019  At the time of writing, it is up 9.91% on the day and trading at $10,693. And it gets better…’FOMO’ could take Bitcoin from $9,000 to $20,000 within months, Fundstrat Global Advisors Co-founder Tom Lee told CNBC this week. “I think it is easily going to take out its all time highs,” he declared. Not everyone is getting out the party balloons and champagne, however. “I’m still not sold on the idea that it’s up, up, up from here,” says Simon Peters, Analyst at eToro. “We’re due a significant correction still and prices could fall back to as low as $6,500 before the next major rise. That said, you can’t ignore the continuing price surge we’ve seen this year.” As for the latest rise, global politics could be one reason, Peters reckons. “It’s busy out there with the US-China trade war rumbling on, a new Prime Minister on the way in Britain and protests in Hong Kong. Some investors will naturally be spooked and are seeking a safe haven in assets like crypto. Bitcoin’s price may have also been boosted by Tether ‘printing’ another $150 million, which has historically been associated with a bump in crypto prices,” he concludes. George McDonaugh, CEO and Co-Founder of KR1, also advises caution, “On the long way up to $20,000 there were five moments where there was a 40% decrease in price. These shake-outs test your staying power and many new entrants will hand their precious coins back to the market,” he says. “We will see huge corrections again, and passing 10k may well be the catalyst that drives us back down, but whatever happens, we’ve been clearly shown that the interest, adoption and money has not in any way left this new asset class.” The post Bitcoin hits $10,000 and heads for all time highs appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Scott Thompson,Coin Rivet,2019-06-22T07:00:17.000Z
"“Crypto winter is still coming,” says a Stark"," A former US Government senior official has ripped into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, warning they could all suddenly be worth nothing. John Reed Stark, who served for more than two decades with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – half of it as head of its Office for Internet Enforcement – used his latest swipe at BTC to carry a foreboding message that crypto will, without warning, have a value of zero.

A former US Government senior official has ripped into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, warning they could all suddenly be worth nothing. John Reed Stark, who served for more than two decades with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – half of it as head of its Office for Internet Enforcement – used his latest swipe at BTC to carry a foreboding message that crypto will, without warning, have a value of zero. In a Coin Rivet article for the Daily Express, the former government finance supremo lays into the whole concept of cryptocurrency in a bile-addled tirade. Stark, who has repeatedly railed against crypto since leaving office, regularly writes articles and essays on why he sides with entrepreneur Warren Buffett in a shared dislike of currencies they both label as “akin to rat poison”. But in his latest article, for Law360, crypto naysayer Stark vents his most furious views yet as he brands initial exchange offerings (IEOs) as “predators” before promising the SEC would soon be clamping down on the “unregulated crypto-casino fundraising mutations”. “They are an enticing medium for fraud, manipulation, insider trading, hacking, and a broad range of chicanery,” he slammed. “IEOs represent yet another blatant attempt to hijack a similar-sounding acronym — IPO — in an effort to lure investors seeking to get rich quick. However, just like ICOs, the IEO has not a single element in common with the IPO (other than the first and last letters of its acronym).” The bulk of his ire, though, is reserved for Bitcoin itself, which he belittles as having no real-world use case other than assisting criminals. “Much of Bitcoin’s value, outside of mere speculation, is derived solely from its ability to facilitate criminal activity,” he argues. “Need a fake ID, bottle of opiates, a cache of credit card numbers, or a thousand Social Security numbers? Need a way to collect a ransomware payment? Need to fund terrorist-related activities? Need to hire a hitman? “Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have become the payment of choice for these, and a slew of other, criminal enterprises.” His closing remarks, however, will send a chill down the spine of would-be crypto investors. “People are going to wake up one day and not find that the value of their BTC investment is diminishing, but that it is zero,” he warns. “One moment you will be looking at $8,000 per coin, the next, global trading will be suspended. The true market of BTC is zero. When it’s stopped, it will just end. “As soon as a system of such kind starts to move outside of the legal constructions that allow it to operate, it stands on a foundation of watered sand and will eventually collapse. “When it collapses, it can never be recovered.”   Have you noticed that Coin Rivet has China covered?

," Cryptocurrency custody startup Casa has rolled out a new mobile app.  Sats App is a noncustodial wallet that allows users to manage their lightning nodes straight from their mobile phone, CoinDesk writes. Casa is planning to add a rewards program to attract more cryptocurrency early adopters, who can earn cryptocurrency and learn about cryptocurrencies and node management. “Features are focused on increasing adoption of bitcoin and lightning nodes,” said Casa CEO Jeremy Welch. “You will be able to earn bitcoin if you don’t have a Casa node, but you will be able to earn bitcoin faster if you have a node.” The app will currently be available only to Casa customers, with a full roll-out planned for later this month. According to Welch, although the app is “lightweight,” it offers multiple actions — earning sats and operating a full node. “It’s private, secure and connects over Tor,” he added. Earlier this year, Casa announced a “core shift” to its business, launching the Keymaster mobile app and plug-and-play Bitcoin Lightning node Casa Node. ",Carol Gaszcz,The Block,2019-07-03T22:20:18.000Z
16," The Bitcoin mining hash rate is currently at 58,000,000 TH/s and is fast approaching its mid-2018 highs of nearly 60,000,000 TH/s. The hash rate has made a surprise comeback after falling to almost half its current total during the December 2018 capitulation in BTC price. The total daily block and transaction reward paid to miners has also seen an almost four-fold increase in the last six months, rising from under $5 million to currently above $20 million a day. Key to the recent rise in miner revenues has been the huge increase in transaction fees, which have gone from a daily total of $63,000 in late March to now more than $1 million a day over the last few weeks. Based on estimates from Litecoin founder Charlie Lee’s September San Francisco conference talk, the current SHA-256 hash rate translates into around $1.8 billion in online hardware value for the Bitcoin mining network. Other hourly costs for the network (based on a $0.1 kwH electricity cost) come to around $540,000 in just electricity for those miners to hunt for 75 BTC that would currently trade at around $660,000. With the next Bitcoin halving just under a year away, between now and then we may see a new bull market break out for Bitcoin mining before the hourly reward drops down to 37.5 BTC. Mining difficulty is also up around 30% from the December low, while the price of Bitcoin has increased close to 280% in the same period. As ROI for mining operations continues to outpace the returns for BTC, the sideline investor may again look to make a move into the crypto ecosystem to get their hands on one of the 3.2 million BTC that are yet to be issued into circulation.

A choppy start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $436.65 to an early afternoon high $465.0. Bitcoin Cash ABC broke through the first major resistance level at $448.64 and second major resistance level at $460.68. An early afternoon slide to an intraday low $431.61 saw Bitcoin Cash ABC steer clear of the first major support level at $431.61 before rallying to an intraday high and new swing hi $515.70. The rally saw Bitcoin Cash ABC break through the major resistance levels before easing back through the third major resistance level at $489.40. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 0.99% to $484.74. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $475.05 to a morning high $498.0 before easing back. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move back through the morning high $498 would support a run at the first major resistance level at $519.93. A broad-based crypto rally would bring $520 levels into play. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $500 levels. Failure to move back through the morning high could see Bitcoin Cash ABC hit reverse. A fall through the morning low to $468 levels would bring $450 levels into play before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of the first major support level at $443.02. Litecoin gained 1.6% on Saturday. Following on from a 2.36% rise from Friday, Litecoin ended the day at $141.46. A relatively choppy day saw Litecoin rise to an early morning high $143.55 before sliding back to sub-$140 levels. The early moves saw Litecoin break through the first major resistance level at $141.93. An early afternoon rally saw Litecoin strike an intraday high and new swing hi $146.0 before sliding to an intraday low $137.35.

At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 0.13% to $141.27. Litecoin rose to a morning high $142.2 before falling back to a low $140.27. The relatively range-bound start to the day saw Litecoin steer clear of the major support and resistance levels. For the day ahead, a hold onto $141 levels would support another run at the first major resistance level at $145.79. Litecoin would need support from the broader market to take a run at the second major resistance level at $150.11. Failure to hold onto $141 levels could see Litecoin fall through to $138 levels before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Litecoin would likely leave the first major resistance level at $137.35 untested. Ripple’s XRP rallied by 7.15% on Saturday. Following on from a 3.28% rise on Friday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.4780. A bullish morning saw Ripple’s XRP rally from an intraday low $0.44322 to an early afternoon intraday high $0.51. Ripple’s XRP broke through the major resistance levels before easing back to $0.46 levels. Finding support late in the day, Ripple’s XRP managed to hold above the second major resistance level at $0.4628 At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 0.67% to $0.48120.

For the day ahead, a move back through to $0.49 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $0.5109. Ripple’s XRP would need support from the broader market, however, to break through to $0.50 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Saturday’s high $0.5100 and the first major resistance level at $0.5109 would likely limit any upside on the day. Failure to move back through to $0.49 levels could see Ripple’s XRP slide through to $0.45 levels before any recovery.

"Bitcoin may soon go parabolic over $12,000 again"," Bitcoin is once more looking bullish as the world’s biggest decentralised asset has found a new influx of buying support to rally close to 20% in price since the start of July. On a backdrop of global turmoils driven by a narrative of trade tensions, a breakout in the gold and commodities markets, and even US President Donald Trump calling out China and Europe specifically for currency manipulation, could this be the perfect storm for Bitcoin to break past resistance and head upwards to fresh 2019 highs? China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games – as they have for many years! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019  Long-time Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos has reminded the community that governments may soon try and “blame crypto for the currency war”, but “the race to the bottom” for state-backed fiat currencies has little to do with the disruptive asset class. Towards the end of last week, Bitcoin continued to grind to defend its five-figure valuation. Unlike other downward price movements that we have seen of late, Bitcoin’s move down did not include any large-scale sell-offs, but instead a series of mini-dumps taking the price down from $12,000 to $10,000. Since this local bottom was hit, we have seen volumes pick up and buyers come back into the market to drive the price back up to the same level where the ‘controlled’ sell-off began. If Bitcoin can now penetrate through the $12,000-$12,400 level of resistance, the move back up to $14,000 and beyond may be quicker than its initial parabolic rise in late June. If the digitally-scarce asset does decide to rally up from this point, the odds of ever seeing an exchange-traded price of under $10,000 will decrease exponentially as fast as any potential move in the opposite direction. Bitcoin will become the global reserve currency. That is why we are all here.  Anything short of this becomes much less interesting. — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) July 4, 2019    The popular Bitcoin analyst Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano recently outlined his $100,000 Bitcoin target for the end of 2021, but the chances are that if we do see all-time highs broken sooner rather than later, a six-figure valuation for Bitcoin may become a reality quicker than even the most bullish commentators in the space would ever expect.

"Altcoins Weekly Analysis – BNB, EOS and ETH – 30/06/19"," Binance Coin fell by 6.28% in the week ending 29th June. Partially reversing a 14.8% rally from the previous week, Binance Coin ended the week at $35.38. A bearish start to the week saw Binance Coin fall from a Sunday high $40.89 to a Wednesday low $32.77 before finding support. 3-days in the red out of 4 saw Binance Coin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $34, whilst steering clear of the major support levels. On a particularly choppy Wednesday, Binance Coin struck an intraweek high $42.91, while also falling to sub-$30 levels. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $43.48, Binance Coin slipped through the first major support level at $31.79. In almost a repeat, Binance Coin returned to $42 levels on Thursday before falling to an intraweek low $27.03. Binance Coin fell back through the 23.6% FIB and first major support level before finding support. Two consecutive days in the green at the end of the week led to a move back through the 23.6% FIB to $35 levels. A move back through to $35 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $43.18. Binance Coin would need support from the broader market, however, to break through to $40 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, last week’s high $42.91 would likely pin Binance Coin back on the week. Failure to move back through to $35 levels could see Binance Coin give up more ground in the week. A fall through to $31 levels would bring the first major support level at $27.30 into play before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off through the week, Binance Coin should steer clear of sub-$20 support levels. At the time of writing, Binance Coin was down by 1.69% to $34.78. EOS tumbled by 15.65% in the week ending 29th June. Reversing an 8.59% rally form the previous week, EOS ended the week at $6.3347. Bearish through most of the week, EOS fell from a Sunday intraweek high $7.6435 to a Thursday intraweek low $5.5500. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Binance Coin slid through the first major support level at $6.8957 and second major support level at $6.2813. Of greater significance was a fall through the 23.6% FIB to visit sub-$6.00 levels for the first time since 6th June. Partially reversing five consecutive days in the red, EOS saw green for the final 2-days of the week to return to $6.3 levels. EOS would need to move through to $6.50 levels to support a partial recovery of last week’s losses. A move through the 23.6% FIB of $6.62 to $6.80 levels would support a run at the first major resistance at $7.4688. EOS would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the 23.6% FIB of $6.62. Failure to move through to $6.50 levels could see EOS fall deeper into the red. A slide through to sub-$6.00 levels would bring the first major support level at $5.3753 into play. Barring another crypto meltdown, however, EOS should steer clear of sub-$4.00 support levels on the week. At the time of writing, EOS was down by 0.96% to $6.2739. Ethereum rose by 2.76% in the week ending 29th June. Following on from a 14.57% rally on from the previous week, Ethereum ended the week at $317.00. A bearish start to the week left Ethereum in the red on Sunday, 23rd June before making a move. Steering well clear of the major support levels, Ethereum rallied to a Wednesday intraweek high $364.49. The rally saw Ethereum break through the first major resistance level at $329.02 and second major resistance level at $349.55. Falling short of the 38.2% FIB of $367, Ethereum joined the rest of the majors in the red on Thursday. Ethereum pulled back through the resistance levels to an intraweek low $273.5. Steering clear of the first major support level at $272.17, Ethereum found support from the broader market to recover to $300 levels. A move through to $318 levels would support further upside in the week ahead. Ethereum would need to move through to $340 levels, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $363.16. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, last week’s high $364.49 and the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside on the week. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Ethereum could break through the 38.2% FIB of $367 to bring $400 levels into range. Failure to move through to $318 levels could see Ethereum hit reverse. A fall through to sub-$300 levels would bring the first major support level at $272.17 into play before any recovery. Barring a Bitcoin meltdown, Ethereum should steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $257.

MoneyGram soars 168% from Ripple investment," On Tuesday, money-transfer company MoneyGram saw its stock soar an eye-popping 168% after banking software company Ripple announced it will buy $30 million of MoneyGram shares at a huge premium of $4.10 per share, with the option to buy another $20 million worth of shares over the next two years. In return, MoneyGram (MGI) has made Ripple its primary partner for cross-border payment settlement using digital assets. Suddenly, crypto looks cool again. After the massive run-up in price of all the top cryptocurrencies in 2017, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and ripple (XRP), prices plunged across the board in 2018. Now, halfway through 2019, coins are up and excitement is returning, although the top cryptocurrencies have also appeared to decouple more than in the past—bitcoin is up far more than anything else. Bitcoin is up 140% this year so far; ether is up 87%, and XRP is up 17%. The fact that a partnership and investment from Ripple had the power to send MoneyGram up a staggering 168% on Tuesday is a sign of bullishness for the space. (By Wednesday morning in premarket, shares of MoneyGram were beginning to fall back to earth, but the point was made.) And Ripple’s announcement of its MoneyGram deal came just one day before Facebook’s announcement of Calibra, its first crypto wallet, to store and send Libra, a new cryptocurrency supported by Facebook, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, Uber, Lyft, eBay, Spotify, and more. It all adds up to hot crypto action involving publicly-traded, household-name companies, still a rare thing for an industry whose biggest players are private startups like Coinbase. Ripple sells software to banks and financial institutions for faster settling of cross-border payments. Its two main products are called xCurrent and xRapid, and the xRapid product relies on the cryptocurrency XRP. Ripple, the company, and XRP, the asset, are separate things, but they are often conflated, particularly since Ripple owns 60% of the supply of XRP tokens, which leads cryptocurrency purists to argue that XRP is not sufficiently decentralized as bitcoin is. As a result, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse told Yahoo Finance on stage at the All Markets Summit: Crypto last year, “There’s a lot of FUD about XRP.” (FUD is fear, uncertainty, and doubt.) Ripple’s former chief market strategist Cory Johnson also identified to Yahoo Finance last year the “religious-like fervor” around XRP. Over the past couple years, Ripple has steadily added a large number of banking clients, but most are using xCurrent, not the product that runs on XRP. Last year, Western Union said it was testing out xRapid, which was taken as a big win for both Ripple and XRP. The deal with MoneyGram will “focus” on xRapid, Ripple says. The company, in its announcement, is touting that XRP “remains the most efficient digital asset for settlement, with transaction fees at just fractions of a penny, compared to other digital asset fees of about $30 per transaction.” — Daniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

For the day ahead, a move back through the morning high $498 would support a run at the first major resistance level at $519.93. A broad-based crypto rally would bring $520 levels into play. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $500 levels. Failure to move back through the morning high could see Bitcoin Cash ABC hit reverse. A fall through the morning low to $468 levels would bring $450 levels into play before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of the first major support level at $443.02. Litecoin gained 1.6% on Saturday. Following on from a 2.36% rise from Friday, Litecoin ended the day at $141.46. A relatively choppy day saw Litecoin rise to an early morning high $143.55 before sliding back to sub-$140 levels.

At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 0.13% to $141.27. Litecoin rose to a morning high $142.2 before falling back to a low $140.27. The relatively range-bound start to the day saw Litecoin steer clear of the major support and resistance levels. For the day ahead, a hold onto $141 levels would support another run at the first major resistance level at $145.79. Litecoin would need support from the broader market to take a run at the second major resistance level at $150.11. Failure to hold onto $141 levels could see Litecoin fall through to $138 levels before any recovery.

Ripple’s XRP would need to move through to $0.4280 levels, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $0.4351. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, the 23.6% FIB would likely pin back any run at $0.42 levels. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB could see Ripple’s XRP fall deeper into the red.

Mati Greenspan discusses the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency," This past week I had the absolute pleasure of speaking to eToro senior analyst Mati Greenspan about how Bitcoin and blockchain technology are developing and what the future holds for crypto. Mati is the grandson of a self-made billionaire, and his long road to financial expertise started at a very young age. During his youth, he would research and write down the prices of assets such as gold and deliver his notes to his grandfather so he could make decisions regarding his portfolios. During our talk, we discussed interesting topics surrounding Bitcoin and blockchain technology, such as how Bitcoin is developing both as a store of value and as a currency, the impact of regulators and governments on the Bitcoin market, the reasons why BTC will keep increasing in price vs fiat and, of course, the future of cryptocurrencies. You can check out the video of our interview below. There’s even a special appearance by a future Bitcoin expert! We started our talk by discussing how Mati was introduced to Bitcoin during his early days at eToro, and how Bitcoin made him completely rethink his perspective on money. First of all, it’s important to underline that Mati’s expertise is primarily in financial markets, with Bitcoin being one of his more recent discoveries having first heard of the asset around 2013. His love for the king of crypto developed due to its decentralised and permissionless nature – something Mati truly prizes for a store of value as no government or agency can directly influence or completely control it. During Bitcoin’s early years, Mati was cautious when discussing the topic, even though he always saw Bitcoin for what it is: an alternative digital currency that is owned by users. Mati believes Bitcoin is a serious contender to gold and other “stable” assets (like oil) even though it can’t currently be used as cash as it’s not widely accepted in the mainstream. Mati mentioned during our chat that he thinks there is a big chance Bitcoin will one day be accepted by merchants, but there’s still a long way to go:  “We’re getting close to full penetration. Everyone (in the developed world) knows what Bitcoin is, even though there are some stigmas. We’ve come a long way from nobody ever hearing about Bitcoin.”  “We’re getting close to full penetration. Everyone (in the developed world) knows what Bitcoin is, even though there are some stigmas. We’ve come a long way from nobody ever hearing about Bitcoin.” Of course, with greater improvements come greater challenges. For instance, Mati mentioned one of the most pressing issues the Bitcoin community is currently facing which wasn’t a big deal back in the early days:  “In 2013, there weren’t many altcoins. Today we have a lot of tribalism.”  “In 2013, there weren’t many altcoins. Today we have a lot of tribalism.” Is there a way cryptocurrencies can adapt and learn how to coexist? Or will the cryptocurrency market remain immature for the next couple of years? Enjoy! https://t.co/9D5p1drbEe — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) May 30, 2019  Mati spoke about the likelihood that Bitcoin will evolve into a form of P2P cash instead of “just” being a decentralised store of value:  “I don’t know that it can – at this point, it appears that ship has sailed. The LN (Lightning Network) is not user friendly, there are liquidity issues, and it’s not easy to use. Although it’s pretty cool to send small amounts. But I don’t see merchants using the Lightning Network. The way I see it, Bitcoin can be used as a global reserve currency.”  “I don’t know that it can – at this point, it appears that ship has sailed. The LN (Lightning Network) is not user friendly, there are liquidity issues, and it’s not easy to use. Although it’s pretty cool to send small amounts. But I don’t see merchants using the Lightning Network. The way I see it, Bitcoin can be used as a global reserve currency.” As a short-term (or potentially long-term) solution, cryptocurrency users simply use other cryptos like Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin in order to send cheap transactions. I agree with Mati when he says it’s simply easier to go down that road than trying to force the LN down everyone’s throats. I personally believe the LN is a great solution, but there are many other potential solutions. We should focus on all the solutions available and not just the one. If there are issues with the LN in the future, there are alternative cryptocurrencies one can use to send money cheaply across the world. We also talked about the role regulators are playing in the crypto space. Mati was quite positive on the overall outlook, but he believes the clear path is to focus on self-regulation:  “Each regulator needs to learn how to treat Bitcoin in their region, as it’s the first time we have a global asset by nature. India banned it. Other places are extremely friendly like Malta, Switzerland, and France. But we won’t have clear guidelines in the foreseeable future and regulation will be done on a one-to-one basis. I believe self-regulation is key (…) and the way to go in the future.”  “Each regulator needs to learn how to treat Bitcoin in their region, as it’s the first time we have a global asset by nature. India banned it. Other places are extremely friendly like Malta, Switzerland, and France. But we won’t have clear guidelines in the foreseeable future and regulation will be done on a one-to-one basis. I believe self-regulation is key (…) and the way to go in the future.” Self-regulation means imposing standards to make sure people have the right access during the right times and do not overstep any boundaries or take actions that would damage the protocol. Basically, it means we need to look out for each other and for Bitcoin. Can #bitcoin completely replace all the money on the planet?! 💵💴💶💰💳💱 My answer is… NO!! Feel free to try and change my mind….. preferably after reading the article, please. 🙏 Click here —> https://t.co/8YHXwOlYsS pic.twitter.com/AfDsYoLGUM — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) May 29, 2019  When the conversation moved towards the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and whether BTC could ever replace the USD as a global currency, Mati spoke about the remote possibility of hyper-bitcoinisation – a hypothesis that argues fiat currencies will be replaced by crypto:  “I don’t think it will happen. I’ve recently written an article why I don’t think Bitcoin will replace all fiat currencies, but what can happen is central banks using Bitcoin as a store of value. Venezuela introduced the Petro, Putin is under pressure from the Russian Central Bank to regulate Bitcoin, and Iran is already working on their crypto-real, as Russia is working on its crypto-ruble.”  “I don’t think it will happen. I’ve recently written an article why I don’t think Bitcoin will replace all fiat currencies, but what can happen is central banks using Bitcoin as a store of value. Venezuela introduced the Petro, Putin is under pressure from the Russian Central Bank to regulate Bitcoin, and Iran is already working on their crypto-real, as Russia is working on its crypto-ruble.” The fact that governments feel the need to buy and store Bitcoin – or at least to regulate it – tells me they’re starting to understand its underlying value. How will the market adapt? I cannot say. I would assume the more participants in the BTC market, the better. Mati concluded our interview by mentioning how Bitcoin is helping the world economy:  “Bitcoin does not need to replace fiat money. If fiat is stable, there is no use case for Bitcoin. Think about a table – the more legs, the more stable. Bitcoin is just another leg to support the entire economy.”  “Bitcoin does not need to replace fiat money.

1," Bitcoin Cash ABC tumbled by 10.4% on Sunday. Reversing a 2.19% gain from Saturday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the week down 15.7% at $396.33. The sell-off left Bitcoin Cash ABC down by 10.5% for the month of June. A choppy morning saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise to an early intraday high $446.9 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $449.99, Bitcoin Cash ABC slid to a late afternoon low $396.36 before finding support. The reversal saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall through the first major support level at $421.59 and second major support level at $402.91. Of greater significance was the fall through the 23.6% FIB of $418. A late recovery to $416 levels was short-lived. Bitcoin Cash ABC slid back through the second major support level to an intraday low $396.33. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 3.41% to $409.85. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rises from a morning low $396.0 to a high $410.11 before easing back. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on, while also falling short of the 23.6% FIB of $418. For the day ahead, a move through the 23.6% FIB would bring the first major resistance level at $430.04 into play. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from $418 levels. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin Cash ABC hit reverse later in the day. A fall through the morning low $396 would bring the first major support level at $379.47 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$370 support levels on the day. Litecoin fell by 8.4% on Sunday. Partially reversing an 11.58% rally from Saturday, Litecoin ended the week down 10.7% at $122.06. The reversal left Litecoin with just a 6.7% gain for the month of June. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin recover from a morning low $126.0 to strike a late morning intraday high $136.81. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $141.47, Litecoin tumbled to a late intraday low $119.03. Finding support at the first major support level at $119.97, Litecoin recovered to $122 levels at the day end. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 1.61% to $124.02. Tracking the broader market, Litecoin rose from a morning low $120.52 to a high $125.56 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move through the morning high to $126 levels would support a run at $130 levels on the day. In the event of an extended rally through the day, Litecoin would likely test the first major resistance level at $132.81. Failure to move back through the morning high could see Litecoin hit reverse. A fall through the morning low $120.52 could see Litecoin test support at the 23.6% FIB of $117. Barring a crypto meltdown, the first major support level at $115.3 should limit any downside in the event of a reversal. Ripple’s XRP fell by 7.4% on Sunday. Reversing a 0.64% gain from Saturday, Ripple’s XRP ended the week down 16.2% at $0.3943. Ripple’s XRP ended the month of June down 9.9%. Bearish through the morning, Ripple’s XRP fell from an intraday high $0.4287 to a final hour intraday low $0.393. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Ripple’s XRP fell through the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164 and first major support level at $0.4083. It was the first time since 13th June that Ripple’s XRP ended the day at sub-$0.40 levels… At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 4.64% to $0.41260. A particularly bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rise from a morning low $0.39013 to a high $0.4160. While falling short of the first major resistance level at $0.4177, the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164 pinned Ripple’s XRP back early on. For the day ahead, a break through the 23.6% FIB would support a rebound on the day. Barring an extended crypto rally, however, the first major resistance level at $0.4177 would likely leave $0.42 levels out of reach. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse. A fall through to $0.4050 levels would bring sub-$0.40 levels back into play. Barring a crypto sell-off, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of the first major support level at $0.3820.

Ethereum Analysis – Support Levels in Play – 03/07/19," It’s been a bearish first half of the week. Following last week’s 2.76% gain, Ethereum was down by 8.13%, Sunday through Tuesday. A bearish start to the week saw Ethereum slide by 8.51% on Sunday to set the tone early on. In spite of finding support on Monday to hold on to $290 levels, with a 1.25% gain, the reversal continued on Tuesday. Ethereum fell by a further 0.84% to end the day at $291.25. Falling from a current week high $323.61 from Sunday, Ethereum fell to a current week low $270.42 on Tuesday. Steering well clear of the first major resistance level at $363.16, Ethereum fell through the first major support level at $272.17 before recovering to $291 levels. While falling back from the 38.2% FIB of $367, Ethereum managed to steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $257. The extended bearish trend, formed at last May 2018’s swing hi $828.97, remained firmly intact, however. Ethereum continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $367, following December’s swing lo $80.6. For the bulls, a breakout from the 38.2% FIB of $367 would be needed to form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 0.67% to $293.19. A move back through to $320 levels would signal a 2nd half of a week rebound. Ethereum would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $300. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, a move through to $320 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $363.16 into play. Barring a crypto rally going into the weekend, however, the first major resistance level and the 38.2% FIB would cap any upside in the event of a bounce back. With volatility returning to the broader market, a break through the 38.2% FIB would bring $400 levels into view. Failure to move through to $320 levels would likely leave Ethereum on the back foot through the week. A fall through the current week low $270.42 could see Ethereum slide through the 23.6% FIB of $257 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ethereum should steer well clear of the second major support level at $227.34. A visit to $260 levels would be on the cards, however, in the event of a sell-off. Major Support Level: $272.17 Major Resistance Level: $363.16 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $257 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $367 62% FIB Retracement Level: $543 This article was originally posted on FX Empire",Bob Mason,FX Empire,2019-07-03T00:09:17.000Z
," At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading close to $9,200 after price spiked during the weekend, climbing 18% from $7,800 to $9,250 in just a couple of hours. It seems the hypothesis that weekends are good for Bitcoin is indeed true. But will Bitcoin maintain its weekend gains during the next few days? Bitcoin experienced a major rally that took its price upwards close to 18% over the weekend. Afterwards, price pulled back closer to its new support level at around $8,800. At the moment, the market is moving upwards with higher lows each time it falls, meaning we should expect BTC to continue its climb towards $10,000 – which in my opinion might come within the next couple of weeks before the end of the month. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal – not only in shorter time-frames but also in daily and weekly ones as well – I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past seven days, volume went from $17 billion to $23 billion, retracing today to the $20 billion region. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $10,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Of course, if you think I might be overreacting to positive news, you can always check what other expert analysts have to say about this recent price movement. It's over 9000!!!! pic.twitter.com/cvJX8Blsgw — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) May 30, 2019  Hopefully, the market will continue this positive momentum.

Mad Crypto: Libra was just the cherry on top of this rally," This post first appeared in Frank Chaparro’s weekly column “Mad Crypto,” which is sent to Genesis members’ inbox every Monday morning.  Pundits and media professionals often struggle to pinpoint the Holy Grail behind each bitcoin price increase. And the 17.2% increase this past week to around $11,000, its highest point in over 15 months, is no different. Naturally, Facebook’s Libra announcement is alluded to at the bottom of many “price posts” out there (such as this one from the Financial Times).  But as our friend Lionel Laurent at Bloomberg News points out in his Sunday morning column, readers would be unwise to attribute bitcoin’s bullish run over the past week solely to Mark Zuckerberg’s plan to gatecrash the digital currency market with a stablecoin-like token backed by giants such as PayPal, Uber, and Visa.  Join Genesis now and continue reading, Mad Crypto: Libra was just the cherry on top of this rally!",Frank Chaparro,The Block,2019-06-24T13:50:14.000Z

The late rally saw Bitcoin rise from an afternoon low $11,038 to a late intraday high $12,025. Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB, first major resistance level at $11,323.93 and second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of green across the crypto-board. Coming in a distant second to Bitcoin was Ethereum, which gained 3.62%. Bitcoin Cash SV (+3.03%), Litecoin (+2.69%), EOS (+2.39%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.25%), Tron (+2.14%) and Binance Coin (+2.10%) also made solid gains on the day. For Stellar’s Lumen, a modest 1.52% gain on the day saw the gap widen with Tron sitting at the number 10 spot by market cap. The Bitcoin rally on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance rising back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 63.1% The total crypto market cap rose from $315bn levels to $337.4bn on Wednesday, supported by Bitcoin’s break out. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.08% to $11,852. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to a morning high $12,065 before falling to a morning low $11,808. Bitcoin left the major resistance and support levels untested in the early hours. Elsewhere, Binance Coin bucked the trend at the time of writing, rising by 0.31%. For the rest of the pack, it was back in the red. Leading the way was EOS, which was down by 2.25%. Litecoin (-1.38%), Ethereum (-1.26%) and Tron (-1.21%) were also deep in the red in the early hours. Amongst the cryptos in reverse, Bitcoin Cash SV saw the most modest loss, down by 0.02% at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,800 levels through the morning to support a rebound later in the day. A move through the morning high $12,065 would bring the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high. Failure to hold onto $11,800 levels could see Bitcoin cough up Wednesday’s gains. A fall through to sub-$11,630 levels would bring the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit any downside in the event of an extended sell-off.

Lightning Labs launches mainnet Lightning Network mobile app," Lightning Labs has released the alpha version of its Lightning mobile app for iOS and Android platforms. With the release of the new mobile application, users can now send Bitcoin instantly around the world using their mobile phone, with full control over their own funds and data. We've released the mainnet alpha of our Lightning Mobile App for iOS & Android, the first on all major platforms! ⚡️📲 Send money instantly around the world. Control your own funds and data with Neutrino and Autopilot. Read more and try it out here: https://t.co/d9V6P2dkzf pic.twitter.com/OnGNI8qik6 — Lightning Labs⚡️ (@lightning) June 19, 2019  Following the recent release of the firm’s Lightning app on desktop, the alpha release on mobile means the app is now available across the full platform suite of iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux. In the announcement blog post, the team said that they had “designed the mobile app to be approachable for a wide range of users”, with “a clean user interface and a goal to hide complexity” for new users. The team also confirmed that as with the desktop app, “the mobile app integrates a fully functional Lightning Network node using our very own LND”. The new mobile app also includes the same two core technologies that power the desktop app. The first, Neutrino, is a “light client specification that allows non-custodial Lightning wallets to verify Bitcoin transactions”, giving improved privacy without needing to sync the full Bitcoin blockchain (which is about 225 GB). The second feature is Autopilot, which helps users select which node to open a channel with (as the team think this is something many users will not be equipped to do). Commenting on the launch, the CEO of Lightning Labs, Elizabeth Stark – seemingly in a nod to the great infrastructure vs service provider debate – said: “When it comes to AOL vs the internet, I’m betting on the internet every time.” It’s still early days, but with the technology-focused company now completing the release of its full suite of interoperable tools for Bitcoin’s most prominent layer-two scaling solution, the project is taking another small step closer to its goal of delivering instant digital micropayments for all.

An analysis of Wrapped Bitcoin," Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is an Ethereum token launched on Jan. 31 as an attempt to bring the liquidity effects of bitcoin (BTC) into the Ethereum ecosystem. WBTCs are backed 1-to-1 by BTC secured by centralized custodians. WBTC’s token contract is governed by a multi-signature contract managed by a group including custodians that manage BTC to burn and mint WBTC and merchants who initiate burn/mint calls on behalf of users who want to trade in their BTC for WBTC, and vice-versa. The Block has analyzed the status of WBTC as the token nears six months on the Ethereum network. Since launching at the end of January, the circulating supply of WBTC has grown 340%, with nearly 320 WBTC (~$3 million) deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

1," How to Buy DASH DASH fell by 1.03% on Sunday. Partially reversing a 4.84% rally from Sunday, DASH ended the week up 10.3% to $173.211. A bearish start to the day saw DASH fall to a late morning intraday low $169.391 before finding support. Whilst steering clear of the first major support level at $157.938, fell through the 23.6% FIB of $172 before finding support. DASH recovered through the afternoon to a late intraday high $179.015. In spite of the late recovery, DASH fell well short of the first major resistance level at $188.315 before falling back to a 2nd half of a day low $170.895. The late pullback saw DASH fall back through the 23.6% FIB of $172 before recovering to $173 levels. Following a 51% gain in May that led to a current year high $198.89, it’s been a mixed month in June. A bearish start to the month saw DASH slide to a June low $135.1 before finding recovering. For the current month, DASH was up 4.34% to the end of Sunday, with last week’s rally pulling DASH into the green. The extended bearish trend formed back at late April 2018’s swing hi $547.97, remained firmly intact in spite of the recovery. DASH continues to fall well short of the 38.2% FIB of $244. At the time of writing, DASH was down by 1.26% to $171.024. A bearish start to the day saw DASH fall from an early intraday high $172.613 to a low $169.286. Whilst steering clear of the major support and resistance levels, DASH fell back through the 23.6% FIB of $172. A move back through the 23.6% FIB of $172 to $173.90 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $178.35. DASH would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $174 levels on the day. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, DASH would likely fall well short of $178 levels on the day. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $172 could see DASH slide back to sub-$170 levels. Barring an extended sell-off through the day, however, DASH will likely steer clear of the first major support level at $168.73. Major Support Level: $178.35 Major Resistance Level: $168.73 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $172 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $244 62% FIB Retracement Level: $360 Please let us know what you think in the comments below Thanks, Bob This article was originally posted on FX Empire",Bob Mason,FX Empire,2019-06-24T02:15:50.000Z
4," While the Bitcoin bulls continued to maintain control, its been another mixed week for the rest of the pack. Bitcoin rose by 2.56% on Saturday. Reversing a 1.42% fall from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,281. On the day, a bullish start to the morning saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,961 to a morning high $11,594 before easing back. The early rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major resistance level at $11,378. Following a relatively range-bound late morning, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $11,720. Falling short of the second major resistance level at $11,753, slid back through the 23.6% FIB to a 2nd half of a day low $11,066. For the bulls, steering clear of sub-$11,000 levels was key late in the day, supporting a move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,280 levels. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 4.45%, which was also supported by 2.29% and 10.09% gains from Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed start to the weekend. Joining Bitcoin in the green for the day were Ripple’s XRP, which led the way with a 3.08% rally. Bitcoin Cash ABC and EOS also ended the day in the green, with gains of 1.59% and 0.19% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.2%), Litecoin (-0.18%), Binance Coin (-0.15%) and Ethereum (-0.09%) saw red on the day, while Tron ended the day flat. For the current week, Bitcoin led the way with its 4.45%, Monday through Saturday. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.7%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+2.33%), and Binance Coin (+2.04%) also saw solid gains. Tron’s TRX and EOS were also in the green with 1.26% and 0.05% gains respectively. Bucking the trend on the week were Litecoin and Ethereum, which were down by 3.1% and by 0.87% respectively. Another choppy week saw the total crypto market cap recover from a Tuesday current week low $288.64bn to a current week high $337.76bn. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $320.33bn. 24-hour trading volumes were on the slide, however. Falling back from $99bn levels on Wednesday, 24-hour trading volumes stood at $62.72bn at the time of writing. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.55% to $11,219. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,276 to a low $11,111 before finding support. Whilst steering clear of the major support and resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, Litecoin recovered from early losses to move into the green, up by 0.06% at the time of writing. Joining Litecoin in the green were EOS (+0.54%), Ethereum (+0.18%) and Binance Coin (+0.02%). Bitcoin Cash ABC joined Bitcoin in the red with a -1.64%, while Bitcoin Cash SV was flat. Bitcoin would need to break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 to $11,320 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $11,680.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $11,720 would likely limit any upside. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,320 levels could see Bitcoin slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $11,111 would bring the first major support level at $10,921.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,900 levels on the day.

13," In February, JPMorgan Chase briefly excited bitcoin enthusiasts when it launched its own cryptocurrency, JPM Coin. But soon after the announcement, the crypto community and tech media aptly pointed out that JPM Coin is an internal token for settling transactions with JPM clients, permissioned rather than “permissionless,” and fully controlled by JPMorgan (JPM)—not so exciting to crypto flag-wavers. In the days since June 18, Facebook (FB) has had a somewhat similar experience. The embattled tech giant announced it would launch in 2020 a new cryptocurrency called Libra (in partnership with a collection of big-name “founding members” including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, eBay, Uber, and Lyft) and a digital wallet called Calibra. While some analysts and research firms are bullish that Libra can bring cryptocurrency mainstream, the cryptocurrency industry mostly has questions and criticism, like whether Libra coin can be truly decentralized when Facebook execs are building it, and whether Libra’s blockchain can ever be truly open and public when there’s a carefully-selected roundtable of “members” behind it. UBS, in a note on Libra, declared, “We have more questions than answers.” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also has questions. “Will they follow banking rules or KYC, BSA, AML,” Dimon said in an interview with Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer, “or will they not? But they obviously want to serve their clients, and that’s fine. I also want to be able to serve their clients, too. We would like to do some of it too, ourselves, and we don’t always want to be forced into someone else’s ecosystem.” Questions about Libra’s plan for KYC/AML Dimon is referring to “know your customer” rules (KYC) and “anti-money laundering” (AML) rules, which stem from the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA). Any U.S. bank or financial service company holding and transmitting money on behalf of customers is required to comply with KYC and with BSA/AML. And Dimon is right to point to those acronyms; other critics have also picked up on the fact that Libra’s white paper makes no mention of KYC, and just one mention of AML (bolding ours): “The existing blockchain systems have yet to reach mainstream adoption... Some projects have also aimed to disrupt the existing system and bypass regulation as opposed to innovating on compliance and regulatory fronts to improve the effectiveness of anti-money laundering. We believe that collaborating and innovating with the financial sector, including regulators and experts across a variety of industries, is the only way to ensure that a sustainable, secure and trusted framework underpins this new system.”   Facebook Libra coin don't need KYC. They have so much more data on the 2 billion people. Not just name, id, address, phone number. They know your family, friends, real-time/historic location, what you like... They know you more than yourself. And now your wallet too. Best AML! Instead of harping on KYC and AML, Facebook emphasizes, in multiple sections of the Libra website and the Calibra press release, that it will keep Libra customers’ financial data separate from Facebook social data. But that doesn’t really address the regulatory concerns Dimon is talking about. Jamie Dimon: ‘Blockchain is real’ Nonetheless, Dimon sounds a lot more bullish on crypto and blockchain than he did when he called bitcoin a “fraud worse than tulip bulbs” in 2017. “Blockchain is real. We have the JPMorgan coin blockchain. And competition is real,” Dimon told Yahoo Finance. But he also thinks the banking system doesn’t really need cryptocurrency. “The banking system has already built Zelle, realtime P2P, and TCH The Clearing House,” Dimon says. “We already have all that. And it’s very cheap, it’s very secure, it shares a lot of information. It goes through all the bank security systems, cybersecurity systems, KYC, BSA, AML. We’re going to have competitors... whether it’s a cryptocurrency competitor or another fintech competitor, we’re going to have competitors. I tell our people, Just don’t guess. You know they’re there. You know they’re coming. You know they want to eat your lunch. Assume it. And it might not be the ones we see. It might be the ones we don’t see.” Facebook is very clearly one of the tech competitors that would like to eat JPMorgan’s lunch—Zuckerberg reportedly has long had ambitions of Facebook getting into banking. Libra appears to be the manifestation of those ambitions, but whether it will catch on with mainstream consumers is far from a given—even with 2.4 billion global users. — Daniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

"Why $10,000 is so Important for Bitcoin"," Thus, the coin continues to follow the technical analysts’ forecasts, reinforcing the demand of market participants and not allowing corrections to cause bearish sentiment. The next most important resistance level is expected at $10000. Price dynamics near this level promises to attract particularly close attention. On the one hand, it is precisely this level that can provoke really strong profit-taking activity. If the growth momentum dries right after touching $10,000, we can see a massive correction, as many will rush to “exit”. On another hand, so far more likely scenario in light of the ongoing rally is that Bitcoin will continue to blaze through resistance levels one by one. Fear of lost profits and desire to join the new crypto rally can further move the prices up. Anyway, the market reaction around $10,000 can be indicative, laying the foundations for the trend for the following days and even weeks. Rumours about Facebook and the Telegram cryptocurrencies have long been in the focus of the crypto market participants. Pavel Durov does not yet make it clear what exactly is happening with the most desired product of the messenger, while a Facebook subsidiary launched a digital wallet Calibra with a cryptocurrency called Libra. The digital wallet will receive support from major brands, including MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, and many other major heavyweights. Thus, a wide range of sellers will be able to get paid via this cryptocurrency. It became known that Calibra has already published Whitepaper, and also launched Test Net. The launch for clients is planned in the first half of 2020. Libra cryptocurrency will be built into WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. It is simply impossible to underestimate such an event, but you should also think about what will happen to the “first” cryptocurrencies. Now the whole market is on the rise: along with BTC, altcoins are also growing. However, it must be admitted: this growth is almost completely speculative. No one wants to spend Bitcoin (BTC) or Zcash (ZEC) on daily expenses, because tomorrow their price may add 10% or more. The same fate awaits Libra or TON if their prices will float freely, and, therefore, the only way to get a massive adoption of digital currency is to make it stable. On the one hand, this will nullify the speculative demand, on the other hand, Facebook’s huge user base will provide Libra with tremendous liquidity and trade volume.

"Brenna Sparks on cryptocurrencies, criticism, and her future"," After rising to prominence in the cryptocurrency scene in 2017 and 2018, Brenna Sparks is now one of the most influential people in the industry. With a wide audience spanning different markets, the adult movie star is striving to promote self-sovereignty through the decentralisation that cryptocurrencies can encourage. Coin Rivet recently had the chance to chat with Brenna about her role with SpankChain, her controversial pick as an influencer, and her views on cryptocurrencies in general. You’re an advisor for SpankChain, what are its goals? The goal is to create a dedicated ecosystem for the adult industry, free from censorship and free from discrimination. Can you explain why you believe SpankChain is an important project? For those not in the know, can you explain the issues currently within the adult industry and how projects like SpankChain can help? Right now, there is a lot of discrimination against adult workers, and it’s only getting worse with the policies that are being pushed at the government level. The banks do not care about you. The government doesn’t care about you. You’re essentially on your own. Whenever such tyrannical behaviour makes an appearance, the only way to defeat it is with technology, and that technology to defeat it is what SpankChain is focused on building. We’re not interested in sitting around waiting for people to make up their minds, nor are we interested in wasting our time picketing. The ones that understand this are out there, building a new path that goes around the current mess, and it isn’t only limited to the adult industry. Have you noticed other industry workers getting involved or has the uptake been slow? The industry is very quick to recognise the importance of cryptocurrencies. It’s not difficult for them to see the solution, unlike the average citizen. What was the first cryptocurrency you bought? You were a fan of the Silk Road if rumours are to be believed. Bitcoin was the very first cryptocurrency. And I was a fan of the Silk Road. It was very useful for people who didn’t have a dedicated weed dealer. Has getting involved in cryptocurrencies changed your outlook politically or economically? Very much. I’ve become a lot more libertarian. As far as economics goes, I follow the Chicago school of thought. What does your involvement in cryptocurrencies look like? Do you trade and code or buy and hold? I trade here and there. I don’t waste my efforts on technical analysis and prefer to focus on fundamentals. I hate owning a lot of coins and prefer to put my money towards coins I really believe in. Of course, I will gamble a bit here and there for fun. You’ve recently started coding, did this interest arise from cryptocurrencies? Is this something you’re looking to get into after your porn career is over? I think getting into crypto has got me close with many developers and has definitely sparked some real interest. It’s too soon to tell if I will do it long term, but so far I’m really enjoying it and learning about concepts I have never ever thought about before, as well as concepts that used to confuse me. The feeling of getting smarter seems to be enough motivation. I’ve always liked the idea of being a nerd, so it’s likely I will be a giant nerd of something one day… maybe coding, or maybe something else. A nerd nonetheless. What other industries do you anticipate cryptocurrencies will disrupt other than the adult industry? I know this sounds a bit crude, but everything. We are talking about currency here, and there isn’t much stuff in this world that money doesn’t intersect in one way or another. Even the very nature of governance is changing with the advent of cryptocurrencies. Real estate, retirement, insurance, health care, company funding, employment, banking, diplomacy, war, you name it – it’s all being re-evaluated. Nothing will remain the same. We’re truly experiencing something that has never existed in the world before, something that effects every human on the planet. You’ve mentioned before that you fancy being a venture capitalist one day. Will cryptocurrencies help achieve these goals? And if so, what kind of industries would you like to invest in? It was something that I played with, but if crypto gets to where I believe it will, I actually think VCs will become obsolete. Why on Earth would anyone want to give up portions of their company in exchange for money when they can fund it without giving up any percentage? One very special thing that nobody seems to talk about is just how much collective support companies get in this space. I believe the future of companies will be very cult-like, where they have large followings that will assist in funding and any other additional support. The role of VCs will be a lot less noticeable than it is today. This is just my guess. As for the industries I’m interested in, I’m most interested in the gaming industry. I think that space will have a huge positive impact and is still full of opportunity. A couple of projects that I’m watching closely right now are Enjin, Decentraland, and Theta. I also have some interest in VR, AI, and fog computing. Has there been a particular highlight that has stood out since entering the world of cryptocurrencies? The amount of money you can make (and lose) in this space never seems to have an end. A person has never experienced an emotional roller coaster until they’ve sat in this industry for at least two years. CoinDesk nominated you as one of the most influential people in the industry for 2018. What was your reaction to that? How did you deal with the criticism that came your way from the nomination? I was surprised and humbled. I really don’t think I deserve it, but hey! I don’t get to decide this. I’m very blessed for it, and it has brought me nothing but opportunities since. The criticisms were expected. It went a bit overboard when people began mobbing me and actually changed some deep philosophical views I had on free speech. After experiencing mobbing, my belief in free speech was damaged pretty badly, and there is very little holding it up today. Now, I find it difficult to justify. It’s not okay to group up and hurt people in the name of free speech. That was a very big change on me for sure, and it didn’t come from reading a book or anything, but simply from experiencing the hurtful actions of strangers. What does the rest of 2019 and 2020 hold for Brenna Sparks? Networking! These next two years are all about networking for me. I want to develop great friendships and partnerships. I’ve gotten my recognition, and now I want to push it to the next level and start working with others.

XRP Keeps Retreating," On the daily time-frame the ascending trend of the XRP has “stumbled over” a long-term resistance line. After a divergence formed on MACD, the price started declining until it broke through the local support line. It might imply further decline up to the long-term support line around 0.2990. Resistance line should be marked at 0.4785; breaking through this line will signal the start of a stable ascending trend. On H4 the XRP tries to take hold at the lower projected channel. The short-term goal of the decline is the support area around 0.3525. Bearing in mind the Stochastic in the overbought area, a drop to 0.3980 is possible after reaching the local goal. The financial world is not ready for new solutions, says Technical Director of Ripple David Schwartz in his interview to CB Insights. He states that the technical solutions by Ripple, such as xRapid and xCurrent, have solved the problem of inter-bank transactions, which was the major issue of the banking system SWIFT. However, banks are not too eager to implement new technologies, being conservative and slow by their nature. Schwartz says that new solutions for payment systems are aggressive, swift, mobile and oriented on accelerated target-hitting. It helps save the time and money. Banks will adopt the new schemes sooner or later, but they are not ready yet. The main problem is that the aspects of market regulation are not thoroughly worked out yet, so the bank ecosystem does not feel completely protected, which is understandable. At the same the very nature of digital assets and blockchain-based approaches is still immature, which also prevents banks from implementing modern technologies. This year the XRP is rising in price slower than the leading currency BTC or other altcoins. It might be due to investors waiting for stronger fundamental catalysts that will provide for long-term rise of the XRP.

2," Bucking the trend from across the broader market, Bitcoin fell by 3.38% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 10.18% rally from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,920. A particularly bearish start to the day on Saturday saw Bitcoin slide from an intraday high $12,338 to an early morning intraday low $11,354. In spite of the early sell-off, Bitcoin steered clear of the first major support level at $11,285.67 and the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Finding support from the broader market, Bitcoin managed to recover to $12,200 levels before sliding back to sub-$12,000 levels. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 9.3%, which came off the back of 4 days in the green out of the last 6. In what was a choppy week for the broader crypto market, Bitcoin was one of just 3 of the top 10 cryptos to be in positive territory for the current week.

A choppy morning saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $12,234 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,390.33, Bitcoin fell to a mid-morning intraday low $11,681. In spite of the pullback, Bitcoin steered clear of the first major support level at $11,397.33 and the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. A move back through to $12,000 levels would support another run at the first major resistance level at $12,390.33. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from this morning’s high $12,234.0. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, Bitcoin would likely come up short of $12,300 levels on the day. In the event of a 2nd half of a day bounce, a breakthrough the first major resistance level would bring $12,500 levels into play before any pullback. Failure to move back through to $12,000 levels could see Bitcoin fall deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $11,681 would bring the first major support level at $11,397.33 into play. Barring an extended broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 on the day.

8," While the Bitcoin bulls maintained control, it has been a mixed week for the rest of the pack. Bitcoin fell by 3.38% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 10.18% rally from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,920. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide from an intraday high $12,338 to an early morning intraday low $11,354. Bitcoin steered clear of the first major support level at $11,285.67 and the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 before finding support. Recovering through the remainder of the day, Bitcoin moved back through to $12,000 levels before a late pullback. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 9.3%, which came off the back of 4 days in the green out of the last 6. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a bullish start to the weekend, leaving Bitcoin to buck the trend on the day. Across the rest of the majors, Litecoin led the way, rallying by 11.6% to reverse most of a Thursday 12.6% sell-off. Stellar’s Lumen (+3.87%), EOS (+2.59%), and Ethereum (+2.46%) saw solid gains on the day. For the current week, Bitcoin led the way with its 9.3% rally, Monday through Saturday. Stellar’s Lumen and Ethereum were also in the green for the current week, with gains of 8% and 3.3% respectively. The rest of the pack were in the red, however, with a broad-based crypto sell-off doing the damage on Thursday. Leading the way down was EOS, which tumbled by 13%. Bitcoin Cash SV and Ripple’s XRP also saw heavy losses, with declines of 10.2% and 9.4% respectively. Bitcoin Cash ABC (-6.34%), Binance Coin (-4.35%) and Litecoin (-2.52%) saw more modest losses on the week. A choppy week saw the total crypto market cap rise from $324bn to a Thursday high $386.6bn before easing back. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $344.83bn. 24-hour trading volumes were also on the up, rising from $70.7bn levels to hit $140bn levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, 24-hour trading volumes stood at $88.43bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 1.88% to $12,144.0. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $11,920 to a high $12,193 before easing back. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed start to the day. Ethereum (+0.71%), EOS (+0.22%), Ripple’s XRP (+0.22%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.66%) were in positive territory. On the slide, however, were Stellar’s Lumen (-1.2%), Litecoin (-0.98%), and Binance Coin (-1.64%). Bitcoin Cash SV was flat with just a 0.05% loss at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $12,000 levels through the morning to support another run at the first major resistance level at $12,390.33. An early move through the morning high $12,193 to $12,200 levels would signal the start of a more material rally on the day. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market for a break out from the first major resistance level. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin will likely come up short of the second major resistance level at $12,860.67. Failure to hold onto $12,000 levels could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall through to $11,850 levels would bring the first major support level at $11,397.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 support levels on the day.

15," Bitcoin has experienced a major rally that has taken its price upwards close to 34% over the past two weeks. Even with minor retracements, the market is moving positively with higher lows each time it falls, meaning we should expect BTC to continue its climb towards $13,000 – which in my opinion might come within the next couple of weeks. While I personally am still bullish, others are predicting a sudden correction. Just a few days ago, in my weekly Bitcoin price analysis piece, I brought up a hypothesis that all bull markets are expected to suffer large corrections of around 30-35% in the early stages. This means we could still see Bitcoin touching its 100-day EMA or even its 200-day EMA despite the bull cycle (which can last a couple of years). Now, another interesting question many people are asking is when will Bitcoin hit $20,000? Something I usually don’t do – maybe only in the shadows – is making price predictions. I have confidence in my long-term analysis, but I see myself more of an investor than a trader. I only care about really long-term price, not short-term price. I don’t think the current or near-term price of Bitcoin to represent how much its worth. In other words, I do not intend to use BTC as a currency on the foreseeable future. Still, as the market has finally recovered (I believe), it’s now time to see where things could be heading up to the end of the year. Will the summer be kind to Bitcoin? Will we see a massive retracement back to the 20-day EMA or will Bitcoin continue to moon to new yearly highs? Looking at the chart above, it’s easy to guess what I think will happen. As long as that green line stays intact and price manages to stay above it, I expect Bitcoin to continue pushing higher and higher. You can see from the chart that the 50-day EMA has crossed the 100-day EMA, and the 20-day EMA is already above both of them. This means we’re clearly in bullish territory. Moreover, Fibonacci levels show BTC is already holding on to the 0.5 retracement level. The next one will be the key 0.618 level, around $13,500. If Bitcoin manages to surpass this level and get to the 0.786 retracement level, going higher than $16,000, I see little reason for a major retracement back to $8,000 or so. Sure, we can expect BTC to hit key support levels along the way, but the trend line is on quite a positive slope. And as they say, you should never go against the trend – just ride it for as long as possible. New trend-line BTC hitting 20k by Jan 2020 – #BTCUSD chart https://t.co/CkRQcB3s5d — Pedro Febrero (@Febrocas) June 25, 2019  This tweet might come back to bite me. However, I’m true to my analysis. I believe Bitcoin will hit $20,000 before 2020, or during January 2020. If you inspect the chart closely, you’ll see there’s a little tunnel connecting the lows of 2018 with the highs of 2017, which by chance of the mighty trading gods happens to cross exactly over early January 2020. What I think this means is that there will be a huge push towards new highs during the New Year. More adoption, more institutional investors, and a further push for Lightning and lower transaction fees will help Bitcoin’s price maintain its positive slope. Additionally, we shouldn’t forget Bitcoin is a living organism. Through the implementation of Segwit, Signature Aggregation, Taproot, Graftroot, and Scriptless Scripts (smart contracts on the Bitcoin network), we can expect the king of cryptocurrencies to become even more resilient and easy to use. Of course, my analysis could be entirely wrong, but I intend to keep checking how my trend line is holding up. Again, if Bitcoin is able to keep pushing forward, my bet is on a $20,000 Bitcoin by 2020. Wouldn’t that be the cherry on top of the cake? Safe trades!

Facebook lobs a 'Hail Mary' as it faces scrutiny over data-sharing practices," Facebook’s (FB) ambitious cryptocurrency project ‘Calibra’ comes as the social media behemoth continues to face scrutiny about data privacy. While Calibra may actually amplify those concerns for some, at least one expert thinks it may help alter the way people view the platform’s data-sharing practices. “This is kind of their ‘Hail Mary’ to actually change the way you look at privacy, but also their ability to grow their next billion dollar market,” R ""Ray"" Wang, Constellation Research Principal Analyst & Founder tells Yahoo Finance’s “The Ticker.” In its description of Calibra, Facebook states explicitly: “Calibra will not share account information or financial data with Facebook, Inc or any third party without customer consent. For example, Calibra customers’ account information and financial data will not be used to improve ad targeting on the Facebook, Inc family of products.” Facebook nevertheless faces an uphill battle. On Tuesday, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) called on the social media company to “agree to a moratorium on any movement forward on developing a cryptocurrency until Congress and regulators have the opportunity to examine these issues.” With Calibra, Facebook is aiming to shakeup the global payment industry. “This is basically the next version of PayPal. If PayPal were to evolve, it would have become a crypto that’s in a P2P (peer-to-peer) digital custodial wallet,” Wang said. “What they’re smartly doing is creating these joint ventures around what we call data-driven digital networks.” In fact, PayPal (PYPL) is one of the 28 founding members part of the ‘Libra Association,’ that will oversee the new digital coin. Other partners include Mastercard (MA), eBay (EBAY) and Uber Technologies (UBER). Wang also predicts Facebook’s cryptocurrency could revamp cross-border commerce. “Just like what’s happening in China today with Alipay, there needs to be an equivalent,” he said. “Because we’re seeing basically a U.S. versus China kind of war on the Internet and on all things digital lifestyle.” — McKenzie Stratigopoulos is a producer at Yahoo Finance.

5," Bitcoin prices topped $9,000 last week and put the token on track to move higher in the near-term. The move resulted in the breakdown of a significant resistance level that had been keeping prices in check. Now that resistance is broken down prices are likely to keep rising but just how far can they go? Simple technical targets based on the peaks set in 2018 suggest $10,000, $12,000, and $16,000 are logical targets. Projecting technical patterns like the run-up to, and subsequent break of resistance at $8,500 gives an equally optimistic target. The magnitude of that move is $5,300, projecting it from the $8,500 resistance line gives a target near $14,000. Momentum is slowing winding down but that is not a concern at this time. momentum remains firmly bullish and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. At current levels, the MACD histogram could take several months to wind down to zero and in that time BTC may have already surpassed its all-time highs. There are several factors driving the rally in Bitcoin. Yes, Facebook’s launch of Libra is helping to support prices but no, it isn’t really that important to Bitcoin other than as a sign of growing acceptance of blockchain technology. The two things that are driving Bitcoin’s price higher is next year’s scheduled halving and this summer’s launch of Bakkt physically-settled Bitcoin futures. The halving is an important event for Bitcoin as it will significantly reduce the number of available tokens. The halving is when the mining reward for Bitcoin is cut in half. After the halving, which occurs next May, each block will only be worth 6.5 Bitcoins. Because the cost of mining will remain the same this means the fundamental value of BTCs all over the world will increase. Bakkt and its launch of BTC futures are important for two reasons in and of itself. First, physically settled BTC futures will increase the volume of Bitcoin trading and that will aid its liquidity. Second, Bakkt is an SEC-approved trading venue. Now that it is cleared to test its futures products we are one step closer to a BTC ETF. The approval of a BTC ETF will be a game-changing event for Bitcoin. What we can expect from the price of Bitcoin over the next few months is this. A steady increase in prices punctuated by periodic tests of resistance and minor consolidations. This should continue up to and until BTC reaches its all-time high. Once BTC reaches its all-time high I see a flood of new money come into the market that may push it up to $50,000 within the next two years.

Coinbase review: Four things you should know," Coinbase has become one of the largest exchanges in the world. Based in the US and operating since 2011, the exchange is often the first place many people go to buy their first ever Bitcoin. Coinbase provides many benefits such as simplicity of use, but it has also received criticism from Bitcoiners as well as many of its customers. Let’s take a look at four things you should know about Coinbase. One of the key benefits of using Coinbase is that it has a simple user interface that is ideal for people who have very little knowledge of the cryptocurrency scene. You can buy and store four of the major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. The signup process follows traditional financial technologies and includes a fairly stringent know your customer (KYC) process. While many traditional Bitcoiners feel uncomfortable handing over their personal details, it is the price of having a regulated exchange. Coinbase is based in the US and is fully regulated. This provides a sense of security for its users. The exchange also holds 2% of cryptocurrency storage online with the rest stored in offline wallets for additional safety. It is insured for any losses to the cryptocurrencies stored online. Coinbase is available in 107 countries throughout the world. However, there are limitations depending on the regulations of the specific country. Payment methods can also vary depending on your location. For those based in the UK, you can top up your Coinbase account with Sterling via debit or credit card, UK bank transfer, or SEPA. The ability to buy cryptocurrency with a variety of payment methods is one of the most attractive aspects of using Coinbase. Many other exchanges, especially those that provide the possibility of converting Bitcoin into altcoins, do not provide such a service. Therefore, if a user would like to trade in altcoins, they often buy Bitcoin from Coinbase first and transfer it over to the necessary exchange. One of the major issues that customers have complained about when using Coinbase is its customer support. On the review site Trustpilot, Coinbase has a 1-star rating. There is a general trend from the reviews left on the site. The first major issue is that the customer support is slow to respond to queries. This is especially problematic when Coinbase can be holding large amounts of a customer’s cryptocurrency, causing distress to the customer. Another issue highlighted by customers of Coinbase is the scripted nature of its customer support. Users have accused Coinbase of making its customer support robotic, making people think the exchange doesn’t care about their issues. The third issue that often appears on reviews for Coinbase is criticism of its referral program. By introducing friends to the service, you can be rewarded with better fees or coins. Yet many people have claimed on Trustpilot that they didn’t receive their rewards for doing so. It should be noted though that as with all reviews, the trend shows that unhappy customers are always more likely to leave a review than happy customers. Another one of the major criticisms of Coinbase is that it charges high fees for its service. There are numerous exchanges that provide a similar service to Coinbase but with cheaper fees. However, thanks to its reputation as one of the largest and easiest exchanges to use, it appears that customers are non-plussed regarding the expensive fees on Coinbase. Despite the high fees, the fact that Coinbase is insured for online losses and has never been hacked (as of the time of writing) means that the high fees might be worth it for many. To be as secure as possible though, you should always keep your Bitcoin in a hardware wallet rather than trusting a third party online. Despite some criticism, Coinbase still remains the main site for new investors to buy Bitcoin. Thanks to its first-mover advantage in the market, the variety of payments possible, and its ease of use, the exchange has marketed itself as the go-to exchange in the space. However, there certainly seems to be room for improvement on the customer support side of the operation judging by the reviews on Trustpilot. But for many who have experience in cryptocurrencies, they will have likely moved on to other exchanges that provide more altcoins and offer much lower fees.   The post Coinbase review: Four things you should know appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Ross Chalmers,Coin Rivet,2019-06-14T11:00:48.000Z
Coinsquare buys majority stake in Just Cash in bid to make world’s ATMs crypto-friendly," Cryptocurrency trading platform Coinsquare is making a bid to make digital assets more accessible.  Coinsquare has announced it has made a controlling investment in software provider Just Cash, whose tech will allow any ATM to sell cryptocurrency. The software does not disrupt the ATM network, no hardware changes are required and there are no additional costs to the operator. Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond believes crypto-friendly ATMs are key to making digital assets accessible to the masses.  “Right now, there is a lack of mainstream cryptocurrency adoption because most people are intimidated by the process to acquire it,” said Diamond. “By using the millions of existing ATMs around the world, we can now bridge the gap and give new users the easiest and most familiar experience to purchase cryptocurrency.”",Carol Gaszcz,The Block,2019-07-04T14:33:48.000Z

A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin rise to a morning high $132.11 before sliding to a low $127.45. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested in the early hours. For the day ahead, a move back through to $130 levels would be needed for Litecoin to take a run at the first major resistance level at $138.41 Barring a crypto rebound, Litecoin will likely continue to come up short of $140 levels. Wednesday’s high and the first major resistance level should cap any upside in the event of a rebound. Failure to move back through to $130 levels could see Litecoin struggle on the day. A fall back through the morning low to $125 levels would bring the first major support level at $122.66 into play. Ripple’s XRP fell by 1.27% on Wednesday. Following on from a 1.81% decline on Tuesday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.45935. A bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rally from an early intraday low $0.45872 to a late afternoon intraday high $0.49342. The rally saw Ripple’s XRP broke through the first major resistance level at $0.4783 and second major resistance level at $0.4908. A late broad-based crypto sell-off did the damage, however, with Ripple’s XRP sliding to an intraday low $0.44374. The reversal saw Ripple’s XRP fall through the first major support level at $0.4526 before recovering to $0.45 levels. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 2.04% to $0.4500. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from a morning high $0.46433 to a low $0.44959. In spite of the early pullback, Ripple’s XRP steered clear of the first major support level at $0.4376. For the day ahead, a move back through to $0.4650 levels would support a run at $0.48 levels. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $0.4873. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, Ripple’s XRP would likely come up short of Wednesday’s high $0.49342. Failure to move back through to $0.4873 could see Ripple’s XRP take another hit later in the day. A pullback through to $0.44500 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.4376 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of sub-$0.43 support levels on the day.

There are numerous social media sites used by the cryptocurrency community. While much of the debate tends to take place over on Twitter, Reddit is also one of the main sources for breaking news and discussion of your favourite cryptocurrency topics. Like anything to do with cryptocurrency, controversy is never far away, with accusations of censorship attached to the main Bitcoin subreddit. Here are three cryptocurrency subreddits you should be following. The largest and most popular subreddit – now with over 1 million members – is also the one that has experienced the most controversy. The issue, like most controversies within the Bitcoin community, stems from the scaling debate. Those who advocated for larger blocks felt that their posts were being censored and theories were espoused that the subreddit was under the control of the Bitcoin company Blockstream. This issue highlights a wider problem with online forums. For many people involved in Bitcoin who align themselves with the crypto anarchist ideology, the right to freedom of speech is a key tenant. Therefore, anyone should in theory be allowed to say what they want without fear of being censored. Yet in practice, this can cause issues. Without moderation, a forum can turn into a cesspool of arguments and bickering with little constructive debate. Ultimately, this whole debate led to the creation of r/btc, where Bitcoin Cash is the cryptocurrency of choice. Roger Ver is extremely prominent on this subreddit, and it ascribes to having no form of censorship whatsoever. If you are a Bitcoin fan, then r/Bitcoin is for you, and if you are a Bitcoin Cash fan, then r/btc is where you should head. r/Cryptocurrency is the second-largest cryptocurrency-based subreddit behind r/Bitcoin. Described as the “official source for cryptocurrency news, discussion, and analysis”, any and every cryptocurrency can be discussed on this subreddit. On the subreddit, you will find plenty of links to articles and YouTube videos mixed with bullish and bearish sentiment. With such a large community, and with the vast array of talking points, the subreddit is extremely active. Whereas other subreddits are specific to certain coins, within r/cryptocurrency, all can be discussed freely. Ask me anything (AMA) events are also common with users submitting who they would like to speak to. r/Ethereum is the main subreddit for anyone who has an interest in the Ethereum platform and cryptocurrency. Unlike the Bitcoin community, although there was a fork creating two separate Ethereums, there is a lot less noise surrounding the controversy. With over 430,000 members, you will find the latest Ethereum news and memes. The subreddit also gains legitimacy by having Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as a moderator. Discussion on price is banned as there is another Ethereum subreddit for price chat. The same goes for mining as well. Instead, you will find the latest news on partnerships and what is happening on the ground level with the Ethereum cryptocurrency. The forum is fairly strict in terms of moderation. You may find that your post has to pass through moderation before it appears on the subreddit. This can limit the more controversial topics, but on the other hand, it keeps the subreddit clean and succinct. If you have a particular favourite cryptocurrency, then there is a high chance it will have its own subreddit. How well maintained and active it is depends largely on the community itself. There are dangers to individual subreddits of your favourite cryptocurrencies. Due to their nature, forums can become mere echo chambers where you’ll see plenty of bullish sentiment despite evidence to the contrary, and a severe lack of constructive criticism. The smaller subreddits are less likely to have volunteer moderators, which can mean that debate often spirals out of control or is non-apparent to begin with. The benefits of individual subreddits are that if you are keen on the latest updates, then there is a high chance news will be posted onto these specific subreddits first. Getting to grips with Reddit can take a little time as it has its own unique online culture. The phrase “don’t believe everything you read on the internet” is an apt one when browsing your favourite subreddits. It is often hard to know a person’s motives behind why they say certain things. If you are interested in learning more about cryptocurrencies, then Reddit can definitely be a useful tool for education and debate. Don’t solely rely on Reddit however – try and pool your knowledge from as many sources as possible to gain perspective.

You can now measure fiat market caps against Bitcoin," The recently launched FiatMarketCap.com lets you imagine a future where Bitcoin is the de facto global store of value. The new go-to tracker “monitors fiat currency market caps in BTC” using measures like the M2 or M3 money supply of nation-state currencies. The different bands of money supply are typically classified as “Ms”. The “Ms” usually range from M0 (the narrowest) to M3 as the broadest classification of total money supply for fiat currencies. Launched website to monitor fiat currency market caps in BTC:https://t.co/U5LilHjxSB  This will be an ongoing exercise tracking Bitcoin's rise against major fiat currencies. — FiatMarketCap (@fiatmarketcap) June 13, 2019  What types of assets are classified into each band of money supply tend to differ according to different central banks, but to give an example, the Eurozone uses the following definitions:   The new website’s “Fiat Currency” tab lists the market cap and price (in BTC) with the nominal amount of fiat currency in total circulation for 116 state-backed currencies. All the currencies have a “max supply” set as “unlimited” – except of course number 35 in the list (Bitcoin) which has a total supply of just 21 million BTC. If you click on the “Countries” tab, you can again see a list of 140 currencies, but this time next to the market cap and circulating supply. You can also see the measure and date of the last money supply audit for each sovereign currency. Topping the leaderboard today is the Chinese yuan, with a market cap of just under 3 billion BTC, or around $27 trillion when priced in USD. Coming in at number two is the US dollar, which the website measures at a market cap of just over 1.6 billion BTC (or $14 trillion). Today you can see that Bitcoin has the 35th biggest market cap on the site ($163 billion). When looking at the Countries tab, BTC is tracking all the way down in 47th place. As Bitcoin’s market cap continues its ascent, it will be interesting to see how this fun experiment will continue to track Bitcoin’s rise against major fiat currencies – watch this space!

," This past week I had the absolute pleasure of speaking to eToro senior analyst Mati Greenspan about how Bitcoin and blockchain technology are developing and what the future holds for crypto. Mati is the grandson of a self-made billionaire, and his long road to financial expertise started at a very young age. During his youth, he would research and write down the prices of assets such as gold and deliver his notes to his grandfather so he could make decisions regarding his portfolios. During our talk, we discussed interesting topics surrounding Bitcoin and blockchain technology, such as how Bitcoin is developing both as a store of value and as a currency, the impact of regulators and governments on the Bitcoin market, the reasons why BTC will keep increasing in price vs fiat and, of course, the future of cryptocurrencies. You can check out the video of our interview below. There’s even a special appearance by a future Bitcoin expert! We started our talk by discussing how Mati was introduced to Bitcoin during his early days at eToro, and how Bitcoin made him completely rethink his perspective on money. First of all, it’s important to underline that Mati’s expertise is primarily in financial markets, with Bitcoin being one of his more recent discoveries having first heard of the asset around 2013. His love for the king of crypto developed due to its decentralised and permissionless nature – something Mati truly prizes for a store of value as no government or agency can directly influence or completely control it. During Bitcoin’s early years, Mati was cautious when discussing the topic, even though he always saw Bitcoin for what it is: an alternative digital currency that is owned by users. Mati believes Bitcoin is a serious contender to gold and other “stable” assets (like oil) even though it can’t currently be used as cash as it’s not widely accepted in the mainstream. Mati mentioned during our chat that he thinks there is a big chance Bitcoin will one day be accepted by merchants, but there’s still a long way to go:  “We’re getting close to full penetration. Everyone (in the developed world) knows what Bitcoin is, even though there are some stigmas. We’ve come a long way from nobody ever hearing about Bitcoin.”  “We’re getting close to full penetration. Everyone (in the developed world) knows what Bitcoin is, even though there are some stigmas. We’ve come a long way from nobody ever hearing about Bitcoin.” Of course, with greater improvements come greater challenges. For instance, Mati mentioned one of the most pressing issues the Bitcoin community is currently facing which wasn’t a big deal back in the early days:  “In 2013, there weren’t many altcoins. Today we have a lot of tribalism.”  “In 2013, there weren’t many altcoins. Today we have a lot of tribalism.” Is there a way cryptocurrencies can adapt and learn how to coexist? Or will the cryptocurrency market remain immature for the next couple of years? Enjoy! https://t.co/9D5p1drbEe — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) May 30, 2019  Mati spoke about the likelihood that Bitcoin will evolve into a form of P2P cash instead of “just” being a decentralised store of value:  “I don’t know that it can – at this point, it appears that ship has sailed. The LN (Lightning Network) is not user friendly, there are liquidity issues, and it’s not easy to use. Although it’s pretty cool to send small amounts. But I don’t see merchants using the Lightning Network. The way I see it, Bitcoin can be used as a global reserve currency.”  “I don’t know that it can – at this point, it appears that ship has sailed. The LN (Lightning Network) is not user friendly, there are liquidity issues, and it’s not easy to use. Although it’s pretty cool to send small amounts. But I don’t see merchants using the Lightning Network. The way I see it, Bitcoin can be used as a global reserve currency.” As a short-term (or potentially long-term) solution, cryptocurrency users simply use other cryptos like Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin in order to send cheap transactions. I agree with Mati when he says it’s simply easier to go down that road than trying to force the LN down everyone’s throats. I personally believe the LN is a great solution, but there are many other potential solutions. We should focus on all the solutions available and not just the one. If there are issues with the LN in the future, there are alternative cryptocurrencies one can use to send money cheaply across the world. We also talked about the role regulators are playing in the crypto space. Mati was quite positive on the overall outlook, but he believes the clear path is to focus on self-regulation:  “Each regulator needs to learn how to treat Bitcoin in their region, as it’s the first time we have a global asset by nature. India banned it. Other places are extremely friendly like Malta, Switzerland, and France. But we won’t have clear guidelines in the foreseeable future and regulation will be done on a one-to-one basis. I believe self-regulation is key (…) and the way to go in the future.”  “Each regulator needs to learn how to treat Bitcoin in their region, as it’s the first time we have a global asset by nature. India banned it. Other places are extremely friendly like Malta, Switzerland, and France. But we won’t have clear guidelines in the foreseeable future and regulation will be done on a one-to-one basis. I believe self-regulation is key (…) and the way to go in the future.” Self-regulation means imposing standards to make sure people have the right access during the right times and do not overstep any boundaries or take actions that would damage the protocol. Basically, it means we need to look out for each other and for Bitcoin. Can #bitcoin completely replace all the money on the planet?! 💵💴💶💰💳💱 My answer is… NO!! Feel free to try and change my mind….. preferably after reading the article, please. 🙏 Click here —> https://t.co/8YHXwOlYsS pic.twitter.com/AfDsYoLGUM — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) May 29, 2019  When the conversation moved towards the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and whether BTC could ever replace the USD as a global currency, Mati spoke about the remote possibility of hyper-bitcoinisation – a hypothesis that argues fiat currencies will be replaced by crypto:  “I don’t think it will happen. I’ve recently written an article why I don’t think Bitcoin will replace all fiat currencies, but what can happen is central banks using Bitcoin as a store of value. Venezuela introduced the Petro, Putin is under pressure from the Russian Central Bank to regulate Bitcoin, and Iran is already working on their crypto-real, as Russia is working on its crypto-ruble.”  “I don’t think it will happen. I’ve recently written an article why I don’t think Bitcoin will replace all fiat currencies, but what can happen is central banks using Bitcoin as a store of value. Venezuela introduced the Petro, Putin is under pressure from the Russian Central Bank to regulate Bitcoin, and Iran is already working on their crypto-real, as Russia is working on its crypto-ruble.” The fact that governments feel the need to buy and store Bitcoin – or at least to regulate it – tells me they’re starting to understand its underlying value. How will the market adapt? I cannot say. I would assume the more participants in the BTC market, the better. Mati concluded our interview by mentioning how Bitcoin is helping the world economy:  “Bitcoin does not need to replace fiat money. If fiat is stable, there is no use case for Bitcoin. Think about a table – the more legs, the more stable. Bitcoin is just another leg to support the entire economy.”  “Bitcoin does not need to replace fiat money.

4," When the price of Bitcoin tore its way to almost $20,000 in December 2017, the bull run was fuelled mainly by retail FOMO. Hardly anyone buying it knew what it was or how it worked. They just saw it rising in value and making a lot of people rich overnight. But Bitcoin wasn’t ready for wide adoption. Transactions were bottlenecked, fees were high, scams were abundant, and the legal panorama was fuzzy at best. However, a lot has changed since then. Here are at least five reasons the Bitcoin bull run is different from 2017. I received an email yesterday with a report from SFOX – an institutional crypto assets dealer – revealing why Bitcoin’s current $11,000 is different from 2017. Today, it’s heading for $13,000, and who knows what tomorrow will bring? While it looks like analyst Tom Lee may have been right predicting that retail FOMO would kick in at over $10,000, this new Bitcoin bull run is far more likely to last longer. Actually the point of the chart is to say “real FOMO” probably starts when #bitcoin exceeds $10,000 as that is a price level only seen 3% of all days… …mathematically equivalent to exceeding $BTC $4,500 in 2017 Looking back, that price was a level that indeed triggered FOMO — Thomas Lee (@fundstrat) May 29, 2019  The industry is so much better placed than it was in 2017. Throughout the bear market, Bitcoin has been building. Usage is up, as is transaction speed, hash rate, and block sizes. These are all key for onboarding more users without the issues suffered a year and a half ago. Better than that, transaction fees are down by 68%. Bitcoin first hit $9,000 USD on Nov 27, 2017. Now that Bitcoin is back at $9,000, what has changed? pic.twitter.com/TY5RMQecES — Kevin Rooke (@kerooke) June 17, 2019  You may notice that payments and volume are down as well. But these are key indicators that Bitcoin has transformed from a payment system to a store of value. More people are HODLing than before, and there ain’t no one buying a pizza with BTC. In 2017, cryptocurrency was still being referred to as the “Wild West”. When people heard the word Bitcoin for the first time, their minds often leapt to the dark web, hackers, or clandestine dealings. Bitcoin had yet to receive the official nod from the US SEC that it was not considered a security under its draconian laws. And people were being conned out of their funds left, right, and centre. It’s true that you still have to be careful out there. In the first quarter of 2019 alone, already more than $1.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency has been stolen through fraud. However, security has improved greatly, usability is better, people are taking more time to educate themselves, and Bitcoin is finally casting aside its connotations of criminal deeds. In 2017, big businesses were staying away from Bitcoin, with the notable exception of Microsoft and a handful of others. We had the head of JP Morgan Jamie Dimon calling Bitcoin “stupid” and all large banks urging customers to stay away. In 2019, JP Morgan has its own cryptocurrency (if you want to call it that) and, rather than just accepting payments in Bitcoin, Microsoft is now building on the Bitcoin blockchain. Then there’s Whole Foods, eBay, and, of course, Facebook. SFOX states:  “The current rally corresponds with at least two major news items for retail and institutional investors: details of Facebook’s crypto project, Libra, and BTC mining company Bitmain’s pursuit of a US IPO. This is the kind of validation for the sector that was largely hypothetical back in 2017.”  “The current rally corresponds with at least two major news items for retail and institutional investors: details of Facebook’s crypto project, Libra, and BTC mining company Bitmain’s pursuit of a US IPO. This is the kind of validation for the sector that was largely hypothetical back in 2017.” Just like big businesses, in 2017, institutions were still looking on at this whole new asset class with a mix of awe and caution. Today, accredited investors and institutions are getting in at a premium. They’re literally scrambling to scoop up Bitcoin before it’s too late. In other words, institutions are FOMO-ing in. Bitcoin is trading at over $11,000 on Bitcoin Invesment Trust (GBTC) with a 37% premium over exchanges. AUM of GBTC alone surpassed $1.2 billion this week. Seems like a strong indicator of a rise in interest from accredited and institutional investors. @barrysilbert pic.twitter.com/SU87zuetch — Joseph Young (@iamjosephyoung) May 29, 2019  In 2017, we had CBOE and CME about to launch their Bitcoin futures products, several hedge funds, and a few blockchain investment firms, but zero major names. Now, firms like Fidelity are storing Bitcoin, Bakkt is entering the space at some point, and major firms like TD Ameritrade are trading it. This Bitcoin bull run is nothing like the last and could have real legs. Bitcoin has now overcome the first hurdle, which was the SEC stating that it was not under its purvue. Yet meaningful regulation has yet to take shape in most corners of the world. However, there are countries like Malta and states like Wyoming blazing the trail as Bitcoin and blockchain-friendly. The conversation about this digital asset has extended beyond dinner parties all the way up to the US Congress. Democratic party presidential candidate hopeful Andrew Yang has even pledged to push through the Token Taxonomy Act in the US if he gets voted in. This will exempt many cryptocurrencies from being labelled securities in the United States. While there are never any certainties when it comes to investing, be it the stock market or cryptocurrencies, this wild price run is definitely different from that of 2017. Bitcoin has done a lot of growing up since then, and the dialogue has reached the highest places. Major corporations are entering the space, institutions are racing to get in on the action, and now it seems that retail traders are interested once more to see just how high this could go.

"Stephen Moore, who was in consideration for the Fed, is considering joining a 'crypto central bank'"," Who needs the Fed? Economist Stephen Moore won't have a seat on the Federal Reserve after withdrawing his name from consideration. But in an email to Yahoo Finance on Tuesday, Moore confirms that he is in negotiations to join the team at Decentral. The story was first reported by Fox Business Network. “I've been just in the last few months really starting to study up on these cryptocurrencies, and what impact those will have on the government currencies,"" Moore said recently on Yahoo Finance's The Final Round. According to Fox Business Network, Decentral is a “crypto central bank,” guided by group of entrepreneurs led by Sam Kazemian. They’re hoping to create a way to help stabilize cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin had more than doubled this year, even before Facebook (FB) and its partners unveiled the white paper for Libra coin. Since the announcement, bitcoin is up another 22%. Bitcoin's comeback has even Fed Chair Jay Powell answering crypto questions at FOMC press conferences. “Digital currencies are in their infancy,” Powell warned. “There are potential benefits here, there are also potential risks.” Regarding the threat of crypto currencies replacing currencies backed by central banks, Powell said, “I think we’re a long way from that.” Like Powell, Moore sees the risks and the benefits for crypto and central banks. ""This represents a new challenge for central bankers that they now have competition from private currencies,” Moore said. “And I think on balance, it's a good thing. And the big question now will be whether the Fed and whether this SEC that come out of these futures trading corporation, whether they will start regulating these cryptocurrencies.” — Follow Jen on Twitter @jensaidit or Instagram @jenrogershere.

Cryptocurrency market update: Bitcoin and alts climbing upwards," At the time of writing, the positive momentum in the crypto markets is still present. Much like the two previous weekends, the entire market has consolidated nicely, despite a bumpy start to Monday. Bitcoin has broken past the $6,000, $7,000, and $8,000 levels with ease. Since then, we touched the $9,000 level for a brief moment, before returning to the $8,500 area soon after. As I mentioned last week, the pump could be linked to the Consensus conference that took place in NY last month, as we’ve seen similar movements prior to this crypto conference in previous years. Also, as we saw during most talks and speeches, loads of crypto enthusiasts clearly see BTC as a store of value. Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset that is helping investors dodge economic and geopolitical risks in the form of trade wars, sluggish GDP growth, and what appears to be a new era of quantitative easing for central banks. For that reason, the coin has emerged as the top-performing asset of 2019, vastly outperforming stocks, bonds, commodities, and government-backed currencies. Let’s take a look at how the top cryptocurrencies performed during the weekend. Bitcoin’s rally went parabolic last weekend, and the momentum lasted throughout most of the week before a 12% dive on Thursday. Bitcoin was sitting at around $8,700 on Sunday before a drop down to $8,500 on Monday morning. The overall momentum seems to be quite positive, although there are some fears price is overbought. Nevertheless, I tend to avoid countering trends, as it’s usually riskier than just going with the flow. If prices are roaring, you probably shouldn’t try to short them. Don’t forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. By looking at the chart above, we’re clearly in a bull run. Not only that, we’ve touched a critical level around $9,000, which could be an indicator the market is looking to continue pushing forward. Looking at the Ethereum chart above, we can clearly see a couple of interesting features. Firstly, the 20-day EMA has crossed the 50-day EMA, which is a very bullish signal. Price is now also trading well above the 200-day EMA. Moreover, there could now be new support forming around $195, just above the 200-day EMA. The newly achieved yearly highs for Ethereum have been brought about thanks to the massive boost in Bitcoin last month. Nonetheless, the 50-day EMA hasn’t crossed the 200-day EMA yet, meaning there is still room for short-term gains. For the time being, I expect ETH to maintain its positive momentum, as I don’t see a reason for the trend to break. Even with lower volumes, price has been consolidating above $250. If Ether maintains its movement upwards, the next target level is around $260, while resistance-wise, it seems we’re getting closer to the $280 and $300 levels. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently sitting above $430 – almost 10% higher than last week – following my prediction that BCH would break the $400 level. Bitcoin is still gaining market-share dominance over most coins, including BCH, and BCH price is currently trading at its lowest against BTC since late 2018. However, this doesn’t mean investors won’t take this opportunity to convert BTC into BCH. Bitcoin Cash has broken the major $350 level around its 20-day EMA, and the 50-day EMA is getting close to the 200-day EMA. Moreover, the trend seems to be quite bullish, even though volumes have shrunk during last week and the weekend. What I expect to happen is altcoins such as BCH, ETH, XRP, and LTC will rise both against BTC (even though prices may drop) and USD. If order books stay on the side of buyers, which will become increasingly difficult the more price goes up, we could see BCH climbing again to $500 and above in just a few days. Ripple (XRP) has had a pretty bullish period as of late. Just look at the chart above. In the space of just a few days, price skyrocketed from about $0.294 to $0.47 – representing a 40% rise. It did crash back to close to its 200-day EMA, around $0.37, before recovering back to above $0.43. Not only that, but XRP managed to cross the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs as volumes went berserk. I expect support to be around $0.43 and then again at $0.38. If the 50-day EMA crosses or touches the 200-day EMA during the week, we should expect XRP to moon past $0.5. Still, volumes are thinner, and that could mean consolidation for a while. Although Litecoin has been underperforming compared to other altcoins during the past two weeks, we shouldn’t forget LTC has been on a bull run since February – and it hasn’t stopped yet. From last week, LTC has gained close to 11%, which is a quite amazing achievement from a coin that was trading around $30 in January 2019 and peaked at $100 in April. Fundamentals remain strong as LTC’s adoption keeps rising due to small fees and faster block times. At the moment, price is trading well above $110, and I expect it to continue to rise towards the $120 level. On the downside, we could see price moving towards the $104 and $99 levels. Last week I wrote my expectation was for price to correct. It didn’t. A smart move is to make small entries both when price corrects around target support levels and if price moves upwards towards resistance levels. Safe trades!

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 04/07/19," Bitcoin led the way on Wednesday, providing much-needed support to the broader market at the turn of the quarter. Bitcoin rallied by 10.09% on Wednesday. Following on from a 2.29% gain from Tuesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,982. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,876 to a mid-morning high $11,584. Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major resistance level at $11,323.93 before hitting reverse. Bitcoin fell back through the 23.6% FIB to sub-$11,000 levels before bouncing back to $11,500 levels. A relatively choppy afternoon saw Bitcoin find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 before a late in the day rally. The late rally saw Bitcoin rise from an afternoon low $11,038 to a late intraday high $12,025. Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB, first major resistance level at $11,323.93 and second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of green across the crypto-board. Coming in a distant second to Bitcoin was Ethereum, which gained 3.62%. Bitcoin Cash SV (+3.03%), Litecoin (+2.69%), EOS (+2.39%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.25%), Tron (+2.14%) and Binance Coin (+2.10%) also made solid gains on the day. For Stellar’s Lumen, a modest 1.52% gain on the day saw the gap widen with Tron sitting at the number 10 spot by market cap. The Bitcoin rally on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance rising back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 63.1% The total crypto market cap rose from $315bn levels to $337.4bn on Wednesday, supported by Bitcoin’s break out. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.08% to $11,852. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to a morning high $12,065 before falling to a morning low $11,808. Bitcoin left the major resistance and support levels untested in the early hours. Elsewhere, Binance Coin bucked the trend at the time of writing, rising by 0.31%. For the rest of the pack, it was back in the red. Leading the way was EOS, which was down by 2.25%. Litecoin (-1.38%), Ethereum (-1.26%) and Tron (-1.21%) were also deep in the red in the early hours. Amongst the cryptos in reverse, Bitcoin Cash SV saw the most modest loss, down by 0.02% at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,800 levels through the morning to support a rebound later in the day. A move through the morning high $12,065 would bring the first major resistance level at $12,379.33 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high. Failure to hold onto $11,800 levels could see Bitcoin cough up Wednesday’s gains. A fall through to sub-$11,630 levels would bring the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, the first major support level at $11,230.33 should limit any downside in the event of an extended sell-off.

The Crypto Week – Bitcoin Leads the Way in a Mixed Week for the Majors," While the Bitcoin bulls continued to maintain control, its been another mixed week for the rest of the pack. Bitcoin rose by 2.56% on Saturday. Reversing a 1.42% fall from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $11,281. On the day, a bullish start to the morning saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,961 to a morning high $11,594 before easing back. The early rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major resistance level at $11,378. Following a relatively range-bound late morning, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $11,720. Falling short of the second major resistance level at $11,753, slid back through the 23.6% FIB to a 2nd half of a day low $11,066. For the bulls, steering clear of sub-$11,000 levels was key late in the day, supporting a move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,280 levels. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 4.45%, which was also supported by 2.29% and 10.09% gains from Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed start to the weekend. Joining Bitcoin in the green for the day were Ripple’s XRP, which led the way with a 3.08% rally. Bitcoin Cash ABC and EOS also ended the day in the green, with gains of 1.59% and 0.19% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.2%), Litecoin (-0.18%), Binance Coin (-0.15%) and Ethereum (-0.09%) saw red on the day, while Tron ended the day flat. For the current week, Bitcoin led the way with its 4.45%, Monday through Saturday. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.7%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+2.33%), and Binance Coin (+2.04%) also saw solid gains. Tron’s TRX and EOS were also in the green with 1.26% and 0.05% gains respectively. Bucking the trend on the week were Litecoin and Ethereum, which were down by 3.1% and by 0.87% respectively. Another choppy week saw the total crypto market cap recover from a Tuesday current week low $288.64bn to a current week high $337.76bn. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $320.33bn. 24-hour trading volumes were on the slide, however. Falling back from $99bn levels on Wednesday, 24-hour trading volumes stood at $62.72bn at the time of writing. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.55% to $11,219. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,276 to a low $11,111 before finding support. Whilst steering clear of the major support and resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, Litecoin recovered from early losses to move into the green, up by 0.06% at the time of writing. Joining Litecoin in the green were EOS (+0.54%), Ethereum (+0.18%) and Binance Coin (+0.02%). Bitcoin Cash ABC joined Bitcoin in the red with a -1.64%, while Bitcoin Cash SV was flat. Bitcoin would need to break back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 to $11,320 levels to bring the first major resistance level at $11,680.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $11,720 would likely limit any upside. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,320 levels could see Bitcoin slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $11,111 would bring the first major support level at $10,921.33 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,900 levels on the day.

4," Cryptocurrencies dropped another $20 billion in combined market value on Monday – less than 24 hours after posting a similar drop over the weekend. The sharp decline in market value was triggered after a single trader unloaded 20,000 Bitcoin on the Bitfinex exchange. In the span of roughly 16 hours, the total cryptocurrency market cap has fallen by over $30 billion, according to TradingView. The total value of the entire market is now $283 billion – the lowest since June. With the exception of Tether (USDT), which has seen its market cap swell in recent months, all of the top-20 coins by market cap were trading lower on Monday. Looking at the chart above, we can see the crypto market has now pulled back a whopping $78 billion from its yearly peak, when it touched $380 billion. Still, the long-term trend remains intact as it’s still above the 20-day EMA. In the past, we’ve seen similar price consolidations during bullish seasons, meaning there’s no reason to panic at all. Last week, I wrote about how the long-term trend of Bitcoin remains positive and that I’m expecting the price to hit $20,000 by the end of the year. What I’m doing personally is taking this opportunity to increase my main portfolio. Whether you want to bet on some prominent altcoins or just buy BTC’s dips, my point is it’s a good idea to take these opportunities to average your buy-ins to disperse your risk over time. Try to buy on a daily or weekly basis instead of waiting for a certain price range. It’s always a safer choice! looks like someone just claimed 20,000 $BTC in shorts on bitfinex… wow pic.twitter.com/QQXiZ1oaFb — Crypto Loomdart (@loomdart) June 30, 2019  In other news, it seems the most recent dip was caused by a huge short-seller who unloaded around 20,000 BTC on the Bitfinex market. Bitcoin’s sharp correction over the last 24 hours has had a cascading effect on the broader cryptocurrency market. At 60% market dominance, Bitcoin exerts a strong gravitational pull on altcoins and tokens. As a result, Bitcoin’s renewed volatility has knocked billions off altcoin values over the past five days. Of course, that followed a parabolic surge that drove the overall market to a high close to $390 billion. If a single sell order was responsible for Bitcoin’s sharp correction, then investors can expect a swift recovery in the short term. Bitcoin whales (oversized holders of the virtual currency) seem to have been responsible for at least two major price reversals in recent months. Each time, markets bought the dip and drove the price to new yearly highs. One of the more dramatic examples of a Bitcoin whale dump occurred in mid-May when prices plunged by more than $1,000 in the span of a few hours. The selloff was caused by a single trader who unloaded 5,000 units of BTC on Bitstamp, a leading digital currency exchange. It’s expected during bull markets for whales to take profits while Bitcoin rises to new yearly highs. I personally will take these opportunities to accumulate some more coins. Safe trades!

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 05/07/19," Bitcoin led the way on Thursday, but this time for all the wrong reasons… Bitcoin tumbled by 6.85% on Thursday. Partially reversing Wednesday’s 10.09% rally to end the day at $11,162.5. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning intraday high $12,065 to a late morning low $11,503. The moves through the morning saw Bitcoin leave the major support and resistance levels untested. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin recovered to an afternoon high $11,922 before taking a hit in the final hour. The final hour sell-off saw Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and first major support level at $11,230.33. For Bitcoin, the only positive of the day was the avoidance of sub-$11,000 levels for the first time since 29th June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was red for all but one of the top 10 cryptos on Thursday. Bucking the trend on the day was Binance Coin, which rose by 1.23%. It was deep red for the rest of the pack. Ethereum was close behind Bitcoin, sliding by 6.29%, with EOS (-5.62%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-5%) also seeing heavy losses. Things were not much better for Ripple’s XRP and Tron, which fell by 4.47% and 4.7% respectively. Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin saw more modest losses on the day. While Bitcoin Cash SV fell by 3.44%, Litecoin fell by just 1.8%. The Bitcoin sell-off on the day led to Bitcoin’s dominance pulling back to 62% levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.5% The total crypto market cap fell from a high $338.45bn to end the day at $319.29bn on Thursday, weighed by Bitcoin’s pullback. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.35% to $11,201. Moves in the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $11,005 to a high $11,287 before easing back. Whilst leaving the major support and resistance levels untested, Bitcoin broke through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 before the pullback. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.71%), EOS (+0.23%) and Ethereum (+0.25%) also found early support. Litecoin and Binance Coin struggled at the start, with losses of 0.56% and 0.6% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to $11,430 levels to support a reversal of Thursday’s losses. A move through to $11,500 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,800 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from this morning’s high $11,287. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could touch $12,000 levels before any pullback. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB to $11,430 levels could see Bitcoin take another hit. A fall through the morning low $11,005 would bring the first major support level at $10,790 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer well clear of the second major support level at $10,417.5 on the day.

Bitcoin dominance on the rise: Will altcoins recover?," If you’ve been following the most recent price action in the crypto markets, you’re probably wondering what’s going to happen within the next couple of weeks – especially if you’re holding some altcoins. Will the bull market be kind to the majority of cryptos like in 2017? Or will we see a sudden drop in interest around altcoins as Bitcoin’s market dominance continues to rise? Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market underwent a sharp correction on Sunday, knocking more than $20 billion off the total market capitalisation in less than 24 hours. The pullback followed a brief period of consolidation that saw Bitcoin struggle to get back above the $12,000 mark. All of the top-20 coins reported losses on Sunday, with Bitcoin falling 6.9% to $11,155, according to TradingView. With the reversal, Bitcoin’s market cap has slipped back below $200 billion for the first time since last Thursday. Even though many cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors are still hoping for an altcoin bull season, the data shows that BTC market dominance is once again on the rise – and it is showing no signs of slowing down. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s market dominance is sitting close to 65%. What this shows us is that investors have been betting heavily on Bitcoin and are not so sure about altcoins – even major ones. Apart from Litecoin and Binance Coin, most of the top-10 cryptocurrencies have been underperforming against Bitcoin during 2019. It seems some lessons have been learned from the ICO craze of 2017/18. Of course, we now have the rise of IEOs, which aim to “disrupt” how cryptocurrency projects raise funds by giving the gatekeeping power to exchanges – entities that have proven time and time again to be untrustworthy. My guess is that Bitcoin market dominance will keep rising until it breaks new all-time highs. There is little evidence that shows an opposite path developing ahead, as most institutional investment is focusing on Bitcoin. There are a couple of things I would like to focus on in this graph. First, let’s take a look at that beautiful pink trend line that started at the top of the bull market in early 2018 and is still going today. What this shows is that bear markets are extremely painful for altcoin holders – but that is not news. More interestingly, we can see there’s a trend for Bitcoin to keep gaining dominance past 70%. If what I believe is correct and Bitcoin dominance grows another 10% before it stabilises, what will happen to altcoins? Well, for starters, I believe most will never recover. The ones that do will moon past previous highs as well. Another interesting indicator is the volume profile on the left, which shows us that Bitcoin’s dominance just crossed an important level: 60% dominance. This level had the most volume both from Bitcoin buyers and sellers. Now that volumes are super thin, I expect Bitcoin to reach $20,000 by the end of the year, and when price plateaus, new entrants will look toward altcoins for gains. We can’t forget that one of the most important drivers of human behaviour is greed. FOMO is what pumps price past previous highs and is what brings new people into the market. Despite everyone, or mostly everyone, saying volatility is bad for Bitcoin and for the cryptocurrency market in general, they seem to forget that without great volatility, there’s no room for huge price swings. And what attracts traders and new entrants the most? Precisely. Bitcoin dominance is clearly on the rise, and it will keep going until it reaches a maximum of 80%. I believe that will happen close to the top of the current bull cycle, and afterwards we’ll see investors and traders switching to altcoins for gains. If you want to get into the market, look at the top performers of 2019, like Litecoin (LTC) and Binance Coin (BNB), and think of what will happen to those coins when Bitcoin dominance declines. I’m pretty confident their prices will go berserk and power past previous highs. Safe trades!

Reversing a 1.48% fall from Monday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,885. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide from a morning high $10,719 to a late morning intraday low $9,728.2. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $10,075 to test support at the 38.2% FIB of $9,734 before bouncing back. Rallying through the afternoon, Bitcoin struck a late intraday high $10,965 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin fell well short of the first major resistance level at $11,218. It was Bitcoin’s first visit to sub-$10,000 levels since 21st June. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red across the crypto-board. Leading the way down was Binance Coin, which slid by 3.65%. Also seeing heavy losses were Litecoin (-3.26%), Tron (-2.89%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (-2.59%), and EOS (-2.37%). Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash SV saw more modest losses of 0.84% and 0.48% respectively. For Stellar’s Lumen, things haven’t improved since falling out of the top ten with a 2.16% loss on the day. With Bitcoin bucking the trend to see green on the day, Bitcoin’s dominance moved back to 61% levels. The total crypto market cap recovered from sub-$290 levels on Tuesday to end the day at $313.2bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 2.73% to $11,182 as the bulls look to restore order. Moves within the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a low $10,876 to a high $11,200 before easing back. While leaving the major support and resistance levels untested early on, Bitcoin came within range of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day for the majors. Ethereum tracked Bitcoin early on, with a 1.01% gain. Tron (+0.94%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.03%), and Litecoin (+1.18%) also made solid gains. Bucking the trend in the early hours, however, was Binance Coin with a 0.31% loss. Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to bring the first major resistance level at $11,323.93 into play. Having failed to touch $11,000 levels on Tuesday, the early move should support a bullish day ahead. An early break through the first major resistance level would bring $11,500 levels into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall back through to $10,500 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,087.13 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,000 support levels on the day.

Ripple’s XRP would need to move through to $0.4280 levels, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $0.4351. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, the 23.6% FIB would likely pin back any run at $0.42 levels. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB could see Ripple’s XRP fall deeper into the red.

39," Facebook (FB) Mark Zuckerberg’s recent announcement of ambitious plans to launch a new, global cryptocurrency called Libra has been met with understandable alarm, particularly among regulators and consumer advocates. Much of the controversy has centered around antitrust issues, consumer privacy, and the ability of crooks to anonymously use the system for illicit purposes. Those are all legitimate concerns, but to my mind, the biggest risks are financial, both to users of Libra and the financial system as a whole. Those risks include the possibility of bank runs, credit disruptions, or consumer losses arising from foreign currency risks or financial mismanagement of the Libra reserve. The best way to understand these risks is to follow the money. Let’s start with the process of buying and redeeming Libra. Most cryptocurrencies, including the granddaddy of them all, Bitcoin, have failed to gain widespread acceptance as a method of payment because of their volatility. Zuckerberg hopes to avoid this problem by backing Libra with a reserve of stable world currencies, including the dollar, Euro, and Swiss franc. So you can buy Libra with pretty much any fiat currency — a U.S. dollar, Brazilian Real, Mongolian Tugrik, Indian Rupee — but the amount of Libra you receive will depend on the exchange rate between your currency and the basket of currencies in the reserve at the time of purchase. When you want to redeem your Libra back into your fiat currency, you may get more. But you may also get a lot less, particularly in developing countries with unstable currencies. It will depend on the exchange rate at the time of redemption. Let’s say you still want to buy this hip new digital coin, regardless of the foreign exchange risk. Where do you get the money? For citizens in the U.S. and other developed countries, the money will probably come from your bank account. It’s not going to hurt the banking system if you withdraw a few hundred a month for Libra transactions. But what if everyone decides they want to replace their bank accounts with Libra? After all, this would be a great way to avoid checking account fees. Retailers will love Libra as a way to avoid paying network fees on debit and credit card transactions. All of a sudden, that giant sucking sound is money coming out of the banks and into Libra’s kitty. You may think, “Fine. Let’s stick it to the banks. Look what they did to the economy in 2008.” But most of that money you withdraw from the banks is money they will no longer have to lend to the economy. So as Libra captures your cash, banks have less to make loans. With a run on the banks, we also get a credit contraction. Now Libra has your money (not the banks) and you have your digital coins. What will Libra do with your money? Libra’s white paper says your digital coin is safe because it will be backed by a basket of the most stable world currencies. But it’s not as if Libra will be purchasing paper money in each of these currencies and piling them in a bank vault. What this really means is that Libra will be taking your money and investing it in instruments denominated in those currencies. The return on these investments is how Facebook and other Libra founders will make money. Thus they will have incentives to invest in instruments that will maximize those returns, which may or may not maintain the stable value Libra’s founders are promising. The white paper promises to invest in low volatility assets such as bank deposits and short-term government securities, using “investment grade” financial institutions as custodians. (Reminder: Lehman Bros had an “A” rating from Standard and Poor’s before its collapse in 2008.) But there is no regulatory body to ensure that it does so, nor to require that Libra’s sponsors put up any of their own capital or reserves to backstop those investments if they go sour. In essence, Libra proposes the failed business model used by money market funds prior to the financial crisis. It wants you to buy Libra on the promise that the coin will maintain stable value, but there will be no regulatory oversight of what Libra actually does with your money and no capital and liquidity requirements that you would typically find with a bank. That structure proved disastrous during the 2008 crisis, when the Reserve Fund, a money market fund that heavily invested in Lehman Bros debt, “broke the buck” and prompted widespread runs on other money market funds. Even if Libra keeps its promise to put your money only in relatively safe bank deposits and government securities, we still have a problem. If the money comes out of banks (where it supports private sector lending) and goes into government securities, we would see a massive re-allocation of resources from the private to the public sectors. If you believe (as do I) that the market is generally a better allocator of economic resources than the government, this re-allocation will serve as a drag on economic growth. Libra says it will also put your money into bank deposits. Bank accounts have the advantage of maintaining stable value. Your bank account balance doesn’t fluctuate as would a securities investment. And perhaps this helps with our bank run problem. You take money out of your bank to buy Libra. Libra puts yours and other users’ money into other banks, which will presumably use it to make loans. But banks do fail, and depositors take losses on their uninsured deposits. So while Libra is saying it’s offering a better alternative to banks because it won’t be taking risk by lending out your money the way banks do, it will be putting at least some of your money right back into banks of its choosing. When you withdrew money from your bank to buy Libra, you probably had less than $250,000 in your account, meaning it was fully protected by the FDIC. But Libra’s founders hope to have a global reserve of hundreds of billions of dollars. Even if they spread the funds among multiple banks, at those levels, the lion’s share will likely be uninsured. Anyone who has followed my writings on blockchain knows that I’m enthusiastic about the use of distributed ledger technology to remove frictions in the payments system. So I don’t mean to sound too negative. The problem is, so long as cryptocurrencies have to rely on fiat currencies to maintain stable value, they will be exposed to the same kinds of risks embedded in the banking systems that support those currencies. I believe most of these risks can be addressed with thoughtful regulation. But before Mark Zuckenberg or anyone else tries to create his own global currency, we need to settle on an adequate regulatory framework to govern them. It would make sense for Congress to give the Federal Reserve Board lead authority for overseeing Libra, given its responsibility to conduct monetary policy and oversee an effective and efficient payments system. It is also an experienced financial supervisor, well-equipped to develop capital and liquidity requirements for Libra and other such ventures. In exercising that authority, the Fed could build on the pioneering work of the New York Department of Financial Services which currently regulates two trust companies which have successfully launched stable coins backed by the U.S. dollar. (Disclosure. I serve on the board of one of those trusts, Paxos.) Technology has the potential to dramatically change how the world pays for things in the future. Whether that transition is beneficial to consumers and businesses or financially disruptive will depend on whether regulators can stay ahead of this potentially rapid transformation. It’s open to question whether Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are the right stewards for a new global cryptocurrency. But by firing this warning shot to government policy makers that such a change is coming and potentially coming soon, they have done a public service.

Now in its eleventh year, it’s already had a massive impact on how people relate to their personal finances, investing, and digital assets in general. Bitcoin’s wild price swings usually snatch the headlines, but there’s a lot more to Bitcoin than its volatility. So, how does Bitcoin work and why is it so revolutionary? Let’s take a closer look. Bitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency (or cryptocurrency) which has no physical coins or notes. Imagine Bitcoin as a computer file that you store on your desktop or smartphone using an app called a “digital wallet”. You can own one Bitcoin or fractions of a Bitcoin. Each Bitcoin can be divided into units called satoshis (similar to cents for the US dollar). Each satoshi is worth 0.00000001 Bitcoin. Users can keep Bitcoin and satoshis in their digital wallets, as well as sell, buy, and send them to other people. One of the most revered characteristics of Bitcoin is its independence from central banks and governments. But how does Bitcoin work without a central authority to control the transactions? Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain which can’t be tampered with or changed. Transactions are finalised quickly and securely from one peer to another. Everything happens without a third party like banks or other financial institutions. Bitcoin is important for many reasons: as a deflationary currency, an alternative financial system, a payment method, and a store of value to name a few. But it has also gained a lot of traction due to its underlying blockchain technology. Blockchain has the potential to disrupt more than just the financial industry. As its name suggests, you can think of blockchain as a chain of blocks. Each new block added to the chain depends on the previous one. This code makes it impossible for users to modify records without being caught, as any change would alter the network and the block would be rejected. Bitcoin is generated every time a new block is validated and added to the blockchain. It’s a complex process called mining that requires a large amount of computational power. Miners use specific hardware to solve the complex mathematical puzzles necessary to validate blocks and receive Bitcoin in return. The Bitcoin blockchain was built to generate a total of 21 million Bitcoin. This means that only 21 million can ever exist. It cannot be printed like fiat currency and its scarcity increases its value while protecting users against inflation. The origins of Bitcoin are shrouded in mystery, as Bitcoin’s creator has remained anonymous. Officially, the person who designed and wrote the code for Bitcoin is called Satoshi Nakamoto. However, no one knows whether this person exists or whether we’re looking at a group of people. Mr Nakamoto claimed to be a man living in Japan, born on 5th April 1975. However, there’s no proof of his identity. This made many early cryptocurrency adopters believe the creator of Bitcoin was a group of cryptography and IT experts from Europe and the United States. The world first heard of Bitcoin in October 2008 when Nakamoto published his white paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. The document described Bitcoin – the first digital cryptocurrency – and the way it worked. A few months later, in January 2009, Nakamoto released the software necessary for launching the network and mining the first Bitcoin. He was the one to create the first block on the Bitcoin blockchain, known as the Genesis block. The creator of Bitcoin kept working on the project until 2010. Then, he passed the control of the source code to Gavin Andersen and disappeared. This move hasn’t affected the growing popularity of Bitcoin. By the end of that year, the first cryptocurrency exchange was launched. In 2011, Bitcoin reached parity with the USD, but the price didn’t stop there. About the same time, new cryptocurrencies entered the market. In 2014, the BTC price went down by 50% and needed more than two years to recover. It was the first time users had to think seriously about the volatility of cryptocurrencies. The pattern repeated itself in 2017 when the price hit nearly $20,000 for one BTC and plunged down to around $4,000 one year later. Today, Bitcoin continues to be one of the most volatile digital assets on the market. So how does Bitcoin work this out to be used as a form of payment? For now, making instant payments with Bitcoin is still a challenge for many owners. The digital coin remains an asset for long-term investments rather than a payment method for the majority of the Bitcoin community (known as HODLers). How does Bitcoin work? There’s no simple answer to this question. It’s similar to a bank transfer, but with significantly lower fees and the chance of making gains (or losses) on your investment. The good news is that users don’t necessarily need to understand how Bitcoin and the blockchain work to invest in it. However, knowledge about market trends and risk management are certainly helpful if you’re planning to take the plunge.

1," It’s been a bearish first half of the week. Following last week’s 2.76% gain, Ethereum was down by 8.13%, Sunday through Tuesday. A bearish start to the week saw Ethereum slide by 8.51% on Sunday to set the tone early on. In spite of finding support on Monday to hold on to $290 levels, with a 1.25% gain, the reversal continued on Tuesday. Ethereum fell by a further 0.84% to end the day at $291.25. Falling from a current week high $323.61 from Sunday, Ethereum fell to a current week low $270.42 on Tuesday. Steering well clear of the first major resistance level at $363.16, Ethereum fell through the first major support level at $272.17 before recovering to $291 levels. While falling back from the 38.2% FIB of $367, Ethereum managed to steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $257. The extended bearish trend, formed at last May 2018’s swing hi $828.97, remained firmly intact, however. Ethereum continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $367, following December’s swing lo $80.6. For the bulls, a breakout from the 38.2% FIB of $367 would be needed to form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 0.67% to $293.19. A move back through to $320 levels would signal a 2nd half of a week rebound. Ethereum would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $300. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, a move through to $320 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $363.16 into play. Barring a crypto rally going into the weekend, however, the first major resistance level and the 38.2% FIB would cap any upside in the event of a bounce back. With volatility returning to the broader market, a break through the 38.2% FIB would bring $400 levels into view. Failure to move through to $320 levels would likely leave Ethereum on the back foot through the week. A fall through the current week low $270.42 could see Ethereum slide through the 23.6% FIB of $257 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ethereum should steer well clear of the second major support level at $227.34. A visit to $260 levels would be on the cards, however, in the event of a sell-off. Major Support Level: $272.17 Major Resistance Level: $363.16 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $257 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $367 62% FIB Retracement Level: $543 This article was originally posted on FX Empire",Bob Mason,FX Empire,2019-07-03T00:09:17.000Z
," Cryptoasset data provider Coin Metrics has released a report showing Kik's claims about its level of blockchain activity and adoption rates for its cryptocurrency Kin are inaccurate. The report, titled: “An Analysis of Kin’s On-Chain Activity” was released today. It analyzed Kin’s blockchain activity to address two specific claims made by Kik on its usage: To analyze Kin’s on-chain activity, Coin Metrics first notes that because Kin has gone through multiple infrastructure changes (there are three versions of the Kin blockchain since launch), the firm will only analyze data from Kin 2 and Kin 3. Kin 2 is a centralized version of Kin’s blockchain designed to be a mid-point for fully transitioning to Kin 3, a blockchain forked from the Stellar protocol. According to Coin Metrics, due to their infancy, blockchains do not share the same level of standardization as traditional applications for estimating activity, such as daily active users. As such, Coin Metrics addresses blockchain activity using two criteria: Operations Count (which Kin uses as evidence to support its claims of activity) and Transfer value. Operations Count Kik defines blockchain activity as “the number of operations on the blockchain in the last 24 hours.” According to Coin Metrics, there are two distinct operations that happen on Kin’s blockchain: payments and account creation. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, account creation is recorded as blockchain activity on Kin 3. As such, blockchain data shows that over the past three months, 36% of Kin 2 operations and 72% of Kin 3 operations have been account creations. And while account creation on Kin could be a good gauge for blockchain activity, Coin Metrics notes that Kin’s blockchain does not require a minimum account balance even though Stellar, the blockchain from which Kin is forking its code, requires a “base reserve” to “prevent empty addresses from bloating the blockchain.” Therefore, Kin accounts can remain empty indefinitely. In fact, roughly 93% of all Kin accounts are empty. Transfer Value Because low-fee blockchains like Kin are inexpensive to transfer transactions on, transfer value, according to Coin Metrics, “is often quite noisy.” An example of “noise,” is if a user moves money between different accounts they own. Coin Metrics has devised an “adjusted transfer value” metric, to remove what it deems noise and spammy behavior. This resulted in the following conclusions: For the first claim, Coin Metrics concludes that, by its nature, a microtransaction platform like Kin will have more transactions with smaller amounts. However, this blockchain activity is ultimately up to how one defines it. If activity were to be measured by payments count, Kin would be considered the most active blockchain. If measured by transfer value, Kin would be considered the least active. According to Coin Metrics, while traditional applications use personal information to identify unique users, blockchains only have addresses, which makes it difficult to determine how many individuals are actually using a blockchain. For its analysis, Coin Metrics uses “active addresses” to address Claim 2. Because Claim 2 is about the number of spenders and earners on Kin, Coin Metrics filtered its data to focus on addresses making payments on Kin’s blockchain. They conclude that: Coin Metrics also adds that, at its peak, there have only been roughly 35,000 Kin addresses with more than 10,000 Kin ($0.23 at time of writing). “This is orders of magnitude less than other blockchains in our sample, which each have at least 1,000,000 addresses that hold at least $1 USD,” Coin Metrics concludes. For Claim 2, Coin Metrics concludes that “although Kin has a relatively high number of active addresses, it has a relatively low amount of addresses with a significant account balance,” and that user comparisons across chains are tricky because they have different use cases and operating costs.",Steven Zheng,The Block,2019-06-24T15:22:15.000Z
'I’m not seeing any flood of money out of gold into cryptos': strategist," The yield curve has inverted and investors are concerned about the threats of tariffs amid the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China and the overall slowdown of the global economy. But amid all the turmoil, gold remains a safe haven and it also is still a go-to investment over increasingly popular cryptocurrencies. “I’m not seeing any flood of money out of gold into cryptos, and if there were, I don’t think the cryptocurrencies would have lost 80% of their value last year,” George Milling-Stanley, State Street Global Advisors’ head of Gold Strategy, told Yahoo Finance On the Move, adding that is what he is hearing from a lot of financial advisors. “They all seem to have a question about cryptocurrencies because their investors, at whatever demographic, are asking them whether this is a good idea,” he said. Gold has so far lived up to its safe haven status, according to Milling-Stanley, because it maintains its value “when your stocks and bonds in your portfolio are going down.” “Gold has managed to maintain its level rather than falling [because of] this general atmosphere of uncertainty that makes people look for safe havens,” he said. “We haven’t seen the collapse in the stock market, that would obviously be helpful for gold prices. The yield curve is giving mixed signals, there seems to be confusion to whether it’s signaling recession or not.” Gold prices tend to go up when the stock and bond market go down. To Milling-Stanley “that’s just gravy. What you’re really looking for is something that preserves wealth rather than necessarily creates it.” He predicts that we will see more volatility in the dollar and especially in the stock market, noting that the fact that stocks have gone up these past nine years has him wary because it’s not expected to continue. “I’m not saying stocks are going to fall off a cliff, but we’re looking for a lot more volatility this year, and I think that’s in line with most economic views,” he said. “Gold tends to do well when everything else is more volatile.” When it comes to recession fears, Milling-Stanley argues there isn’t a “strong signal” for worry. In making his argument for gold, beyond just a safe-haven asset, Milling-Stanley said its a good long-term investment. “Over the long-term, gold does give you a reasonable rate of return. Over the last 50 years, for example, gold on a compound annual growth-rate basis has returned 7.5% a year. That’s not too bad at all for an asset that doesn’t have a yield or a coupon.” When deciding just how much to allocate, Milling-Stanley would recommend 5%. He told Yahoo Finance, “between 2% and10% would make sense as a strategic allocation. If you think we’re about to go into a period of extreme turbulence in markets, a view I happen to hold, then it can make sense to double those allocations.” All in all, “somewhere between 2% and 20% — personally, I like 5% as a strategic allocation,” he said.

5," Speaking on stage at the London CryptoCompare conference last week, Thomas Lee claimed that the size of the global crypto community may be only half a million people. Lee believes that “crypto is a lot smaller” than most people think. He said that although most people seem to agree that crypto is a “1.9 million user market”, he thinks that there are closer to “500,000 people in the world that own crypto”. Bullish $crypto twitter is way better than during the bear market. — Emptybeerbottle (@Fullbeerbottle) June 16, 2019  The Fundstrat Global analyst said that “one way to measure this is to look at crypto Twitter”.  He said that a “huge number of followers on crypto Twitter is generally around 100,000”, and that only a few people have close to 1 million followers on their account. Lee himself has only 70,000 followers. Comparing this to a mainstream community like global soccer, even the 500 most popular players have close to 1 million social media followers. He said that this could potentially be really bullish because if “Bitcoin is at over $8,000 with only 500,000 followers, imagine what Bitcoin’s price is going to be when you have four and a half million” people interested in the technology. The co-founder of Fundstrat Global reiterated over the weekend that “crypto winter is over”, adding that with Bitcoin back at new 2019 highs, “don’t those old highs [$20,000] look like a few FOMO days away?” In his talk, the regular CNBC guest told the audience: “If Bitcoin trades above $10,000, then chances are that we will see $40,000 in the next five months.” @fundstrat: “If #Bitcoin trades above $10,000 then chances are that we will see $40,000 in the next five month”@CryptoCompare pic.twitter.com/fWh1SMiyg1 — Nawaz Sulemanji (@coinrivetnawaz) June 12, 2019  Speaking exclusively to Coin Rivet after his talk, Lee told us: “$10,000 could happen soon, because if you take the 10 best days for Bitcoin in any given year, two good days in Bitcoin can take you right back to $10,000.” Although he couldn’t see any catalyst on the horizon in the short term, he did say that anyone who thinks Bitcoin can’t return to its old highs is “kind of sceptical, because they’re ignoring history”. With the wealth transfer between baby boomers and millennials now in full swing, Lee again reiterated on stage that the next bull run in crypto could likely take Bitcoin to well over $100,000 – as more and more young people make the choice to allocate capital towards digital assets instead of traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds that were favoured by their parents’ generation.

ErisX receives licence for digital asset futures trading from CFTC," Cryptocurrency exchange ErisX has announced that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the US regulatory agency with jurisdiction over futures markets, has granted the company a derivatives clearing organisation (DCO) license under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). According to a recent blog post, the exchange is now planning to make digital asset futures contracts available for trade on its regulated derivatives market later this year. Our DCO license is the next step in ErisX’s evolution & mission to improve the digital asset space. We worked collaboratively w the CFTC to establish a clearinghouse guided by proven regulatory frameworks that protect participants and market integrity. https://t.co/xHN4giM5lr — ErisX_Digital (@ErisX_Digital) July 1, 2019  In addition to its new DCO license, ErisX has reportedly held a Designated Contract Market (DCM) license since 2011. ErisX launched its spot markets in April this year, with the promise of eventually rolling out a single digital asset platform for spot and futures trading. At the moment, the ErisX spot market exchange includes US dollar trading pairs with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. The firm has said that its clearinghouse will comply with the 17 core principles of the CEA. This includes establishing standards and procedures to protect users, risk management capabilities, and rule enforcement policies across the platform. According to ErisX CEO Thomas Chippas, the exchange will stand apart from its competitors in using a two-stream DCO and DCM system to separate trading and settlement. The CEO added: “This reflects the structure that institutional investors expect from other asset classes and will help drive these markets toward greater relevance and accessibility.” Dean Carlson, head of digital asset investments at Susquehanna International Group, also commented on the regulatory approval, stating: “The frameworks and regulations in place on the ErisX platform ensure not only security and transparency, but familiarity in a nascent asset class.” For more news, guides, and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.

4," Bitcoin has a carbon footprint equal to that of Las Vegas, according to scientists. Boffins at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) have figured out that the world’s most dominant cryptocurrency is responsible for pumping out around 22 megatons of carbon dioxide every year – the same amount as the infamous US home of 24-hour casinos. Researchers at TUM analysed masses of data such as the IP addresses of Bitcoin ‘miners’ who eat up vast amounts of electricity to harvest pieces of the cryptocurrency. Miners set their machines up to solve various mathematical conundrums in order to execute transactions to be rewarded with Bitcoins, but the cost in electricity to do so can often outweigh the value of the coin itself. This, says the TUM research team in a Coin Rivet article for the Daily Express, poses the question of what effect Bitcoin is having on climate change. Bitcoin accounts for more than half of all the world’s cryptocurrency transactions, meaning the shocking figures produced by the German scientists could easily be doubled. “Bitcoin’s power consumption may only be the tip of the iceberg,” says the report by lead researcher Christian Stoll. “Including estimates for three other cryptocurrencies adds 30 TWh to our annual estimate for Bitcoin. “If we assume correlation to market capitalisation and consider only mineable currencies, this more than doubles the power consumption we estimate for Bitcoin.” The power usage for mining Bitcoin alone is the equivalent of the power output of Sri Lanka, the paper confirms. Stoll concludes: “Participation in the bitcoin blockchain validation process requires specialised hardware and vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant carbon footprint.” It’s a concern that has raised eyebrows within environmental campaign group Greenpeace. “The latest analysis of the energy footprint of Bitcoin reaffirms what has been well documented previously – the energy intensive nature of bitcoin mining is driving significant new demand for electricity, particularly in places like China and Korea that remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels” said Gary Cook, Greenpeace Senior IT Sector Analyst. “If Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hope to maintain their social license in a world that is increasingly driven to action by the Climate Emergency, not only must there be changes to the ‘Proof of Work’ model to make mining far less energy intensive, but mining must also be restricted to locations where mining is powered by renewable sources of electricity, and not driving new demand for fossil fuels.” Is Bitcoin braced for its next bull run? https://coinrivet.com/bitcoin-bull-run-imminent-expert-says/ The post Bitcoin’s carbon footprint is same as Las Vegas appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Darren Parkin,Coin Rivet,2019-06-16T20:25:26.000Z
1," Open margin interest on Bitfinex has fallen by 23% since the start of the week to reach a new 12-month low. Since Bitcoin failed to hold its $8,400 support on June 3, open interest for BTC/USD shorts and longs on Bitfinex has fallen from 45,000 to 37,000 BTC. Given the price drop in Bitcoin from $8,400 to its current level of $7,800, the decline in open margin interest equates to a drop of $88 million, as we have seen nearly 4,400 shorts and 3,300 longs close over the last three days. The Hong Kong-based exchange offers margin trading on its BTC/USD market but only to the extent of 3x leverage. Given its low leverage and trusted reputation in the industry – it has proven resilient in surviving hacks and seizures over the last seven years without any impact to its markets or deposit/withdrawal capabilities – many consider the exchange a cornerstone of the BTC infrastructure for large holders who are looking to trade or stabilise their volatile crypto holdings. With open margin interest on Bitfinex currently at around $290 million, this represents a 12-month combined low in USD terms. In BTC terms (a good measure of sentiment due to the scarce nature of Bitcoin), BTC shorts topped out at around 43,000 BTC in December 2018 and longs at around 37,000 BTC in February this year. Given that the current combined margin interest is around 37,000 BTC (after falling 7,700 BTC since the start of the week), it looks like traders may be getting ready to move their capital from Bitfinex to trade at other exchanges like Binance, which is set to launch its own margin trading platform that is rumoured to provide just 2x leverage. Another popular option for margin traders who are looking for a bit more leverage and liquidity in the market would be BitMEX, which recently experienced over $10 billion worth of volume in a 24-hour period on its popular 100x perpetual swap product. Over the last 12 months, you can see from the chart above that shorts seem to be trending up again, following a dramatic short squeeze as Bitcoin went parabolic during the month of May. The last short squeeze saw the shorts go (as a percentage of open BTC margin interest) from 63% all the way to a low of 42% in one of the most dramatic swings over the last year. With Bitcoin seemingly finishing its short-term parabolic rise, the margin interest has been flip-flopping around 50% as the market works out if we are currently at a fair valuation given a backdrop of trade wars and the inversion of long-term yield curves in traditional markets. The open interest in the margin BTC/USD market on Bitfinex peaked at over $1 billion in the 2017 bull run to $20,000. It may have fallen by nearly $100 million this week, but I think that this is more likely a case of traders doing a ‘sell in May and go away’ tactic before the next storm in this OG margin and funding market for the world’s biggest decentralised asset class.

," As the stablecoin wars continue to heat up, Bitfinex is looking to bring USDT to more blockchains, announcing earlier today that it will launch its stablecoin on EOS's blockchain. Currently, Tether is issued on the Omni Layer, Ethereum, and TRON. In the next couple of weeks, the company is also planning to issue USDT on Blockstream's federated sidechain Liquid. But chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino told The Block that the firm has ambitions to bring the stablecoin to other blockchains, saying that it will launch the coin on Lightning Network sometime this year. As part of those efforts, Bitfinex has joined a group of developers and companies called RGB, which is working to put more assets on the Lightning Network.  Lightning Network is a layer-two protocol that aims to enable quicker and cheaper bitcoin transactions.  ""I think that is one of the coolest things we could ever being [sic] involved with,"" Ardoino said in an email to The Block. ""We really love LN (I personally do a lot) so we want to make sure we learn and contribute to it with our resources,"" he added. Bitfinex has long had intentions to launch of Lightning Network, according to a company update dated September 2017. Implementing tether on Lightning Network could possibly improve the speed of transacting with the coin, the firm has said. ""We are excited to announce the initial discovery and integration discussion with the Lightning Network team for low-cost, instant transactions of Tether currencies on the Lightning Network,"" according to the update. Tether would be the first mainstream asset to be issued on the Lightning Network, which could help the second layer protocol in furthering its adoption. Tether's competitors, USD Coin, TrueUSD, PAX, Gemini dollar are all issued exclusively on Ethereum. Bitfinex and Tether, its affiliated firm that manages its stablecoin USDT, has been embroiled in a dispute with the New York Attorney General's office over the co-mingling of funds. Still, its market capitalization, which took a beating after the NYAG imbroglio, has recouped its losses, hitting a new high above $3.1 billion.  Tether isn't alone is hitting new highs. Elsewhere, PAX has picked up slightly under $70 million in additional market cap over the last month. Meanwhile, USDC has increased by $100 million over the same time period.",Frank Chaparro,The Block,2019-05-31T20:39:08.000Z
," Bitcoin Moves $1,400 Up, $1,400 Down, Speculators Get Woozy Is Bitcoin (BTC-USD) popping again? In both directions? Yup. The digital currency exploded over $1,000 per coin yesterday reaching a high of $13,775 before dropping over $1,400 in the space of about two hours, spurring murmurings of a second echo-bubble bursting in the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin trading as a percentage of total cryptocurrency trading volume has increased significantly since April in the meantime, climbing back up above the 60% mark for the first time ever since breaking below it during the introduction of Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) and other popular coins. During the previous Bitcoin top in December 2017, BTC trading dominance reached 60% but didn’t cross it. We are now at 62.8%. The runner up is Ethereum (ETH-USD) at just below 10%, and Ripple (XRP-USD) at 5.66% total trading volume. The next resistance zone for Bitcoin is at around $17,560, though we are still far away from there. It could take hours.

Hong Kong Back To the Streets Hong Kongers are going back to the streets coinciding with the big G20 meeting this weekend, and they want Hong Kong on the agenda. Beijing isn’t too excited about this, and doesn’t want anyone to talk about it, because it makes them look bad, because it is bad. While the extradition bill that Beijing-sponsored Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has championed (probably because her bosses on Beijing would probably do something bad to her if she didn’t) was suspended, it was never withdrawn, which means that Lam is just waiting for the opportunity to reintroduce it and pass it through while the protesters are not looking. The bill would allow Beijing to extradite pretty much anyone it wants to on the basis that Xi Jinping feels like it. “We know that the G20 is coming. We want to grasp this opportunity to voice for ourselves,” said Jack Cool Tsang, a protester. How can anyone disagree with a guy named Jack Cool? It’s unthinkable. Meanwhile, Hong Kong stocks are in a holding pattern, near all time highs but waiting to see what happens next. (NYSEARCA:EWH) Target, eBay To Compete With Amazon Prime Day Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is just under 3 weeks away, set to hit the internet on July 15 when everyone is supposed to log on to Amazon at once, join prime, and shop like there is no recession around the corner. Target (NYSE:TGT) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are now stepping up to the plate in a bid to compete, daring Amazon.com to crash like it did last year on Prime Day so that it can offer even more sales. They are trying to one-up Amazon by not requiring any membership in order to enjoy the discounts. Amazon requires that people who want the deals sign up for a $119 a year Prime membership. Boeing 737 Has  A New Problem, May Not Return to Service Until July or Later Last month, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration had been saying that the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX series could return to service around late June, which is now, but now they have discovered a new flaw in the plane which they are not elaborating on, but cautioning that at this point, the soonest that the plane could do test flights for certification would be July 8th. Two people involved in the testing though gave a hint as to what is going on. During a simulator test last week running scenarios trying intentionally activate the safety system that pulled the nose down causing two crashes, it took too long to recover, Reuters was told. At this point it isn’t known whether whatever the problem was can be fixed with further software tweaks, or if the problem is in the hardware controlling the system, which would require new hardware be built, which would take a while. Boeing shares slipped late yesterday when news came out, but still finished the day positive.   The post Market Morning: Bitcoin ReBubble, Target India, Hong Kong Keeps Protesting appeared first on Market Exclusive.",ME Staff,Market Exclusive,2019-06-27T11:00:50.000Z
," Count this as the latest attempt by a cryptocurrency exchange to take a piece of the perpetual swap pie. IDG-backed KuCoin has announced the beta launch of its derivatives trading platform, KuMEX. To start, the new platform will offer trading of its so-called Bitcoin Perpetual Contract (XBTUSDM).  KuCoin is the latest cryptocurrency exchange to announce its intention to gatecrash the market for cryptocurrency derivatives, a space currently dominated by behemoth BitMEX. Houbi, Binance, and Bitfinex have recently launched or announced the impending launch of their own platforms to trade perpetual swaps, a synthetic way to bet on cryptocurrencies.  As part of its attempt to lure traders to the new venue, KuMEX will offer rebates to certain traders. “At the same time, KuMEX offers a negative fee for Makers at a rate of -0.025% with a certain amount of fixed commission, encouraging users to provide liquidity to the platform through making the market and earning some commission as an incentive,” the press release reads. Furthermore, the platform uses Bitcoin Spot Index that volume-weights the price of bitcoin in six major exchanges—Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, Liquid and Bittrex. According to the press release, by using figures from more exchanges, KuMEX hopes to achieve a more “fair and rigorous” bitcoin index price. Meanwhile, rival BitMEX prices its swaps based on data from a pool of three exchanges.  KuCoin also announced a trading competition, with a reward of 10,000 KCS for users with top scores in their return rate ranking.",Carol Gaszcz,The Block,2019-07-08T14:47:12.000Z
"Correlation between cryptocurrency prices is decreasing, but still strong"," Cross-asset correlations are still high, but they seem to be decreasing, according to new analysis by The Block.  A major issue for cryptocurrency investors is the inability to truly diversify their cryptocurrency holdings. When the price of one cryptocurrency falls, generally the majority of other cryptocurrencies will fall as well. The lack of uncorrelated permissionless cryptocurrencies has a negative effect on the creation of on-chain crypto-collateralized derivative markets with sufficient liquidity. In early January, The Block performed a similar analysis and found that cryptocurrency prices were highly correlated in 2018, with correlation growing substantially from 2017. In 2018, the most correlated cryptocurrency was Ethereum followed by Bitcoin while the least correlated was TRON.

"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 30/06/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC rose by 2.19% on Saturday. Following on from a 3.69% gain on Friday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $440.28. A particularly bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC slide to an early morning intraday low $412.62. Whilst steering clear of the first major support level at $406.36, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the 23.6% FIB of $418. Finding support from the broader market, Bitcoin Cash ABC bounced back to a late intraday high $441.02. While breaking back through the 23.6% FIB, Bitcoin Cash ABC came up short of the first major resistance level at $445.63. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 0.66% to $443.18. Moves through the early morning saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise to a morning high $446.9 before easing back to a low $440.22. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold onto $440 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $449.99. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high $446.9. In the event of a crypto rally, the second major resistance level at $459.71 could come into play before any pullback. Failure to hold onto $440 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC take a hit on the day. A fall through to sub-$431 levels would bring the first major support level at $421.59 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$420 levels. In the event of a sell-off, the second major support level at $402.91 should limit any downside on the day. Litecoin surged by 11.58% on Saturday. Following on from a 4.68% rally form Friday, Litecoin ended the day at $133.21. Tracking the broader market, Litecoin fell to an early morning intraday low $115 before a late morning rebound. While steering clear of the first major support level at $113.95, Litecoin fell through the 23.6% FIB of $117. The rebound saw Litecoin break through the first major resistance level at $123.4 and second major resistance level at $127.32 to strike a late intraday high $136.5. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 1.13% to $131.70. A bearish start to the day saw Litecoin slide from a morning high $134.68 to a low $130.5 before finding support. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold onto $130 levels through the morning would support a run on Saturday’s high $136.5. Litecoin would need support from the broader market to break out from $136 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Litecoin would likely fall short of the first major resistance level at $141.47. Failure to hold onto $130 levels could see Litecoin struggle through the day. A fall through to $127 levels would bring the first major support level at $119.97 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Litecoin should steer clear of sub-$110 support levels. Ripple’s XRP rose by 0.64% on Saturday. Following on from a 4.36% gain from Friday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.42611. An early sell-off saw Ripple’s XRP slide to an intraday low $0.4010 before finding support. The reversal saw Ripple’s XRP fall through the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164 and the first major support level at $0.4054. Recovering through the rest of the day, Ripple’s XRP moved back through the 23.6% FIB to strike a late intraday high $0.42943. In spite of the rebound, Ripple’s XRP came up short of the first major resistance level at $0.4351 on the day. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 0.05% to $0.42589. A relatively range-bound start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from a morning high $0.42870 to a low $0.42387. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move back through the morning high $0.4287 would support a run at $0.43 levels. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $0.4367. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Saturday’s high $0.42943 would likely cap any upside on the day. Failure to move back through the morning high $0.42870 could see Ripple’s XRP fall deeper into the red. A fall through the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164 would bring the first major support level at $0.4083 into play.

New Raspberry Pi capable of running a Bitcoin node is selling for just $35," The Raspberry Pi Foundation has released a new, more powerful model of its single-board computer. The new device will cost $35 a unit and has the capacity to run full nodes cheaply on the Bitcoin network. Earlier versions of the Raspberry Pi have been popular with Bitcoin enthusiasts and decentralisation advocates as it provides a low barrier to entry for those interested in running their own full nodes on the network. Raspberry Pi 4 is here! A tiny, dual-display desktop computer, with three RAM variants to choose from, and all the hackability you know and love. On sale now from the familiar price of $35: https://t.co/d9iwVidexm #RaspberryPi4 pic.twitter.com/4fll4gx1Ax — Raspberry Pi (@Raspberry_Pi) June 24, 2019  Using the device to run a Bitcoin node allows users to verify their own transactions over the Bitcoin network independently without having to trust third-party wallets or custodial service providers. Unlike miners, who are rewarded with BTC for validating transactions, full nodes do not get compensation for their contribution to the network in the form of hosting and transmitting updated copies of the blockchain (or distributed transaction ledger).   At the time of writing, of the 10,516 reachable Bitcoin nodes on the network, we can see that almost 40% are geographically located in either the United States or Germany. The new Raspberry Pi model (4th version) represents a significant upgrade on earlier versions. Its most expensive option – with 4GB of RAM – will cost just $55 (excluding tax). It also comes with a new operating system, which the Foundation claims comes with a host of back-end technical improvements, a modernised interface, plus support for updated applications such as the Chromium 74 web browser. In the years since Pi’s initial release in 2012, other hardware options have emerged for use as a Bitcoin full node as well. These include HTC’s Exodus 1S smartphone, which has Bitcoin full node capability and was released this May. For more news, guides, and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 08/07/19," Bitcoin closed out the week in positive territory, resuming what has been a particularly bullish run since January. Year-to-date Bitcoin has seen just 8 weekly losses, 2 of which came in June. On Sunday, Bitcoin rose by 1.85%, following on from a 2.56% gain on Saturday, to end the day at $11,485. It was a relatively range-bound first half of the day. Bitcoin eased back to a mid-morning intraday low $11,110 before recovering to a late morning high $11,375. The late morning rally saw Bitcoin break through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 that provided much-needed support through the morning. Falling back from $11,400 levels struck in the middle of the day, Bitcoin slipped through the 23.6% FIB to $11,150 levels before finding support. Bitcoin bounced back to a late intraday high $11,620 before easing back. In spite of the afternoon rally, Bitcoin came up short of the first major resistance level at $11,680.33. For the week, the weekend gains delivered a 6.34% rise for the week ending 7th July. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was green across the board for majors on Sunday. Leading the way on the day were Tron’s TRX and Ethereum, which saw gains of 8.94% and 6.52% respectively. EOS also outperformed Bitcoin on the day, rising by 3.28%. The rest of the pack saw more modest gains. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+1.79%), Ripple’s XRP (+1.81%), Binance Coin (+1.91%), and Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.96%) stood alongside Bitcoin on the day. Litecoin saw the most modest gain of the day, however, rising by 1.71%. For the week, Tron’s TRX led the way, rallying by 10.06% to cement its position in the number 10 spot by market cap. Bucking the trend in the week was Litecoin, which fell by 1.52%. Bitcoin’s dominance held onto 62% levels, having peaked at 63% levels on Thursday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 62.1%. The total crypto market cap rose from $313.57bn to a high $337.76bn on Thursday before easing back to $330bn levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.39% to $11,440. Moves at the start of the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $11,547 to a low $11,413. Bitcoin steered clear of the major support and resistance levels early on. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash ABC and Tron’s TRX bucked the trend early, rising by 0.49% and by 0.29% respectively. The rest of the pack were in the red, with Bitcoin Cash SV leading the way down with a 1.47% loss. Bitcoin would need to hold onto $11,400 levels to make a move later in the day. A move through the morning high to $11,600 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $11,700 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Sunday’s high $11,620 and the first major resistance level will likely limit any upside. Failure to hold onto $11,400 levels could see Bitcoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. A pullback to $11,200 levels would bring the first major support level at $11,190 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 support levels on the day.

Bitfinex margin interest falls by $88 million as Bitcoin drops below support," Open margin interest on Bitfinex has fallen by 23% since the start of the week to reach a new 12-month low. Since Bitcoin failed to hold its $8,400 support on June 3, open interest for BTC/USD shorts and longs on Bitfinex has fallen from 45,000 to 37,000 BTC. Given the price drop in Bitcoin from $8,400 to its current level of $7,800, the decline in open margin interest equates to a drop of $88 million, as we have seen nearly 4,400 shorts and 3,300 longs close over the last three days. The Hong Kong-based exchange offers margin trading on its BTC/USD market but only to the extent of 3x leverage. Given its low leverage and trusted reputation in the industry – it has proven resilient in surviving hacks and seizures over the last seven years without any impact to its markets or deposit/withdrawal capabilities – many consider the exchange a cornerstone of the BTC infrastructure for large holders who are looking to trade or stabilise their volatile crypto holdings. With open margin interest on Bitfinex currently at around $290 million, this represents a 12-month combined low in USD terms. In BTC terms (a good measure of sentiment due to the scarce nature of Bitcoin), BTC shorts topped out at around 43,000 BTC in December 2018 and longs at around 37,000 BTC in February this year. Given that the current combined margin interest is around 37,000 BTC (after falling 7,700 BTC since the start of the week), it looks like traders may be getting ready to move their capital from Bitfinex to trade at other exchanges like Binance, which is set to launch its own margin trading platform that is rumoured to provide just 2x leverage. Another popular option for margin traders who are looking for a bit more leverage and liquidity in the market would be BitMEX, which recently experienced over $10 billion worth of volume in a 24-hour period on its popular 100x perpetual swap product. Over the last 12 months, you can see from the chart above that shorts seem to be trending up again, following a dramatic short squeeze as Bitcoin went parabolic during the month of May. The last short squeeze saw the shorts go (as a percentage of open BTC margin interest) from 63% all the way to a low of 42% in one of the most dramatic swings over the last year. With Bitcoin seemingly finishing its short-term parabolic rise, the margin interest has been flip-flopping around 50% as the market works out if we are currently at a fair valuation given a backdrop of trade wars and the inversion of long-term yield curves in traditional markets. The open interest in the margin BTC/USD market on Bitfinex peaked at over $1 billion in the 2017 bull run to $20,000. It may have fallen by nearly $100 million this week, but I think that this is more likely a case of traders doing a ‘sell in May and go away’ tactic before the next storm in this OG margin and funding market for the world’s biggest decentralised asset class.

22," A charity founded by Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong is donating cryptocurrency to citizens in Venezuela, with the country roiled by famine, disease and political turmoil. As Venezuela’s political and economic crisis reaches a boiling point, GiveCrypto.org has figured a workaround to a widespread shortage of money. The organization is donating cryptocurrency to Venezuelans in need, to buy groceries and household goods. “We early on selected Venezuela as where we are going to work, primarily because money is so broken there,” said Joe Waltman, executive director of GiveCrypto.org told YFi PM in an interview. The lack of food and money has worsened a crisis that’s driven nearly 4 million of its citizens from the oil-rich Andean nation, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Those who can’t leave the country are at extreme risk of starvation, as surging prices erode the value of Venezuela’s currency. Venezuela’s collapsing economy has been hit by skyrocketing hyperinflation, power cuts and shortages of food and medicine. It’s prompted some to look to the crypto market for solutions. Over the last year, the Venezuelan government has created its own digital currency, called the petro, to help ease the crisis. And at least one other charity, called Airdrop Venezuela, is collecting cryptocurrency donations to distribute to 100,000 Venezuelans. Meanwhile, GiveCrypto.org works by recruiting on the ground “ambassadors” who will identify persons in need. Each participant will receive $10 paid in Ethereum (ETH) per week for six weeks. The organization will employ a field contractor to help recruit local vendors that accepts cryptocurrency payments and sell primary items like food and household supplies. “We have people on the ground who are trusted, who understands the situation in their communities,” Waltman told Yahoo Finance. “We rely on them to select people that are in need, and we directly transfer cryptocurrency to the people who are ambassador-select,” he added. The cryptocurrency payment and transaction is managed through Coinbase’s “Wallet Lite” app that is enhanced with Spanish-language options, and compatible with Android 4.1 and above. GiveCrypto.org said recently that this will help reach 96% of Android users in Venezuela.  Volatile price swings in the crypto market might make GiveCrypto’s solution seem curious. However, with an annual inflation rate at over 1,000,000%, digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are relatively more stable than the Venezuelan bolivar. “On the vendor side, it’s not that hard of a pitch,” Waltman explained to Yahoo Finance. “If you go to a local corner store and say, ‘Hey, we’re going to be distributing cryptocurrency...to x people within 500 meter radius from your store, do you want to be the only place they can spend this?’” he asked. “Most small business owners will jump at that chance.” Some of the biggest donors so far are well known figures in the cryptocurrency world—including Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse— and former “Mighty Ducks” actor Brock Pierce, who is director of the Bitcoin Foundation. “We expect the crypto community is probably the place to where we will be getting a good chunk of the donations,” Waltman said. “Our mission is in line with some of the early crypto people.”  Grete Suarez is producer at Yahoo Finance for YFi PM and The Ticker.

"Market Morning: Swiss Bans Stocks from EU, Bitcoin Breaks Below $10K, USTR Wants More Tariffs"," Switzerland Bans Trading of Swiss Stocks in EU Switzerland is having a row with the European Union, so it decided to ban trading of its stocks on EU exchanges. These include Novartis (NASDAQ:NVS), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGF), and Roche (OTCMKTS:RHHBY) among others. Europe said it would no longer recognize Swiss stock markets as having the same status as those of EU members, so Switzerland ordered the EU exchanges to stop trading Swiss stocks in retribution. CNN is extrapolating that this disagreement has implications for Brexit, but that’s a stretch, given that trading must continue if the European economy is to maintain any semblance of integration and the politicians that get into these sorts of fights want to keep their tax revenues flowing. Sooner or later, probably sooner, new agreements will have to be sketched out by necessity and trading continued. Otherwise, investors will find other ways to buy and sell securities and the political class will be blamed for any losses. SEE: FSD Pharma Gets License to Sell Cannabis for Medical Use Bitcoin Continues To Collapse Bitcoin (BTC-USD) may not be storing value very well, but it sure is providing a lot of opportunities for short term traders to both make and lose a lot of money.  Daily trading volume continues to trend to new record highs, hitting a record $44 billion a day this month as the cryptocurrency appeared to have topped out for a second time since 2017, this time at around $13,775. So far we are down 28.3% in six days, matching the pace of the crash following the high of $20,001.50 reached on December 17, 2017. Six days later back then, Bitcoin had fallen below $12,800 but recovered somewhat until mid January when it began another fall to $9,600. The decline in Bitcoin is leading the decline in other cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) down less than half of Bitcoin’s decline over the last 24 hours. The downward momentum could be feeding on itself while attracting short sellers into the futures markets, meaning a short term bounce may be due, as it was during the last sharp decline at around this time following the last top. This, in turn, could further encourage more short term traders into the market, pushing daily trading volume even higher. As Bitcoin trading volume hits new records, more are using Bitcoin trading software to spot sentiment changes in order to capitalize on price changes. CEO of CryptoMiner Solutions had this to say of the current volatility, “’Buy the fear, sell the greed’ is the name of the trading game. Our auto trading software reflects this daily.” Easier said than done, though successful traders do add to overall price stability by buying low and selling high. USTR Wants More Tariffs on European, Olives, Cheese, Whiskey, because Airplanes If you like to eat pizza with olives from Europe while drinking whiskey and not paying any tariffs, then you’re in for some bad news. The US Trade Representative’s office has released a list of products, including all of the above, that could be hit with taxes in addition to the $21 billion in taxes that were already announced in April. The fight has to do with subsidies for Boeing (NYSE:BA), an American company, and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY), a Dutch company, who both get subsidies from their respective governments, paid for buy their respective taxpayers. So, in order to “level the playing field” each government is threatening to burden their taxpayers even more with more taxes on totally unrelated foods and alcoholic drinks and fruits grown and produced by companies that have absolutely nothing to do with airplanes whatsoever. Talk about getting caught in a crossfire. Speaking of Boeing, 737 Grounding Keeps Dragging On Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has thrown a monkey wrench in the engines of all 737s still grounded, though not literally, as it announced that it will remove all its 737s from its fleet until after October 1 at the earliest. Boeing had earlier estimated that the 737 fleet would be back in the air by September, so Boeing fell 2% on the news yesterday. Defending the move, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told Fox, “Being proactive like this helps us reduce the last-minute cancellations and allows us to rebook our Customers well in advance, so that’s important that we continue to stay ahead of this.” Southwest has already removed 150 daily flights from its schedule. Hong Kongers Break Down Legislature Doors On the 12th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, Hong Kong residents chose to celebrate by bashing in the doors of the legislature and defacing the portraits of politicians who make laws there on behalf of the Communist Party of China. A Union Jack colonial flag, the flag of Hong Kong before it was handed over to China, was draped over the desk of the legislature’s president, and slogans were spray-painted across the building. Hong Kong stocks remain resilient, perhaps rooting for the protesters to keep China’s authorities at bay and maintain whatever is left of liberty on the island. Interestingly, the Hong Kong dollar, pegged to the US dollar, is up half a percent against the US dollar since June 10, a big move for a pegged currency.   The post Market Morning: Swiss Bans Stocks from EU, Bitcoin Breaks Below $10K, USTR Wants More Tariffs appeared first on Market Exclusive.",ME Staff,Market Exclusive,2019-07-02T13:13:37.000Z

," ZenGo, a provider of non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, is adding support for Facebook's upcoming cryptocurrency Libra, according to an announcement Tuesday. The firm has released a proof-of-concept for Libra testnet, using a cryptographic technique called threshold signatures scheme (TSS), which helps create a secure and easy-to-use transaction process. ""TSS removes the burden of the single atomic private key and splits the responsibility between multiple parties. Each of the parties generates its own secret and uses this secret to distributively sign a transaction without revealing the secret to the other parties,"" ZenGo explained. Facebook's crypto subsidiary, Calibra, will be launching a default custodial wallet for storing Libra, but that could hinder mass adoption of the cryptocurrency because users would have to trust Calibra to store their coins, ZenGo CEO, Ouriel Ohayon, told The Block. ""True ownership comes with non-custodial options which Libra seems to encourage too. The challenge is to get a large number of users unfamiliar with security, key management and complex backup process to cross that path. It's great to see that developers can build true non-custodial Calibra alternatives where users control their funds,"" Ohayon added. ZenGo wallet currently supports bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) cryptocurrencies. It is currently also preparing to add support for Binance's BNB, Zilliqa's ZIL and Tezos' XTZ tokens, with more cryptocurrencies planned for the future, per the announcement.

3," Thus, the coin continues to follow the technical analysts’ forecasts, reinforcing the demand of market participants and not allowing corrections to cause bearish sentiment. The next most important resistance level is expected at $10000. Price dynamics near this level promises to attract particularly close attention. On the one hand, it is precisely this level that can provoke really strong profit-taking activity. If the growth momentum dries right after touching $10,000, we can see a massive correction, as many will rush to “exit”. On another hand, so far more likely scenario in light of the ongoing rally is that Bitcoin will continue to blaze through resistance levels one by one. Fear of lost profits and desire to join the new crypto rally can further move the prices up. Anyway, the market reaction around $10,000 can be indicative, laying the foundations for the trend for the following days and even weeks. Rumours about Facebook and the Telegram cryptocurrencies have long been in the focus of the crypto market participants. Pavel Durov does not yet make it clear what exactly is happening with the most desired product of the messenger, while a Facebook subsidiary launched a digital wallet Calibra with a cryptocurrency called Libra. The digital wallet will receive support from major brands, including MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, and many other major heavyweights. Thus, a wide range of sellers will be able to get paid via this cryptocurrency. It became known that Calibra has already published Whitepaper, and also launched Test Net. The launch for clients is planned in the first half of 2020. Libra cryptocurrency will be built into WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. It is simply impossible to underestimate such an event, but you should also think about what will happen to the “first” cryptocurrencies. Now the whole market is on the rise: along with BTC, altcoins are also growing. However, it must be admitted: this growth is almost completely speculative. No one wants to spend Bitcoin (BTC) or Zcash (ZEC) on daily expenses, because tomorrow their price may add 10% or more. The same fate awaits Libra or TON if their prices will float freely, and, therefore, the only way to get a massive adoption of digital currency is to make it stable. On the one hand, this will nullify the speculative demand, on the other hand, Facebook’s huge user base will provide Libra with tremendous liquidity and trade volume.

2," The Persian Gulf is Boiling Iran shot down a US drone in the Straits of Hormuz, the narrowest point of the Persian Gulf, the biggest oil shipping lane in the world. The Iran Revolutionary Guards claimed credit for the move, the first time the country has admitted to playing a role in blowing something up belonging to another country since tensions started to rise in the area ever since the Trump Administration reinstituted sanctions against the country. The hit happened in international airspace, which could intensify any excuse to strike back, since the US is allowed to fly drones over international airspace and shooting them down is a technically a “provocation”. The drone was an RQ-4 Global Hawk according to Iran, and a US Navy MQ-4C Triton according to the US. Iran claims it was shot down over Iranian airspace, and the US demurs. Oil is up on the news past $55 a barrel. (NYSEARCA:USO) Gold Breaks Through 5-Year Resistance  Although rates were held steady yesterday after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the Federal Reserve clearly signaled to markets that rates would be cut after the next meeting. At least if they aren’t, stocks are going to crash, given the dovish wording and the universally noticed lack of the word “patience” when addressing possible rate cuts in its press statement. In response to this, in addition to the biggest month in terms of government spending in US history, and equal signals of easing coming out of the European Central Bank, gold pushed through 5-year resistance at $1390 last night, hitting a high of $1397, though has since pulled back to the mid-$1380’s. Gold is now up about 9% in a month. (NYSEARCA:GLD) Call the Village People, Mexico Approves the USMCA Mexico approved the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), a rehash of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), except it has the letters that President Trump wants in it instead. The deal was approved by a vote of 114-4, with three abstentions. Apparently, the threat of tariffs against Mexico made 2 weeks ago are now completely forgotten. With Mexico ratifying the agreement, the United States and Canada still have to give it the go-ahead. In order for that to happen, Democrats in the House of Representatives will have to resist the urge to mess up Trump’s plans, a prospect too tantalizing for them to bypass. Blackstone Says that China Trade War Won’t Cause Recession Blackstone (NYSE:BX) CEO Stephen Schwarzman isn’t all that concerned about the trade war with China and doesn’t think that it will cause a recession, though conceding that the whole ordeal is a “high-wire act,” though he seems to think that there are pillows to break the fall if they trip.  “It’s not that big of a game to throw us into recession,” he told CNN Business in an interview. In one sense he may be right, in that the tariffs may not by themselves cause a recession, but if one is already coming, the tariffs will definitely make the situation that much worse. Schwarzman believes that upcoming talks between Trump and Xi, which were confirmed recently, would help reshape the relationship. Blackstone is at all time highs, and if Schwarzman is wrong, that means the stock could take a beating if he is positioning the investment group according to his positive economic outlook. Gundlach Says Trump May Not Run for Reelection If he’s down enough in the polls, he may not run, and he’s pretty down. If the economy goes into the crapper, “…there’s very little for him to run on ,” said the newly crowned “Bond King” Jeffrey Gundlach, who has apparently taken title from Bill Gross, the previous Bond King. Trump is trailing every Democratic candidate currently running, and even struggling to keep Texas, a typical GOP stronghold, against Joe Biden. “I am not even sure he’s going to really run,” said Gundlach to Fox’s Neil Cavouto, hedging his bets and not quite predicting that he will necessarily bow out. However, Trump is known to bail from fights that he thinks he cannot win. If he drops out, Vice President Mike Pence may take the baton, though China would certainly cheer if this were to be the case, since the trade war would quickly evaporate. Deutsche Bank Get Punched in Gut, Again Duetsche Bank (NYSE:DB), not having a particularly good decade, is being investigated yet again for alleged crimes of money laundering. Shares are down 2.2% in the premarket in Germany, though the ADR is trading about 0.9% up in the wee hours in the United States. The situation is a bit complicated by the fact that Deutsche is a big lender to Donald Trump, which probably doesn’t want any more information out about his finances than is already exposed. The stock is skirting all time lows and has already publicized plans to stuff some of its bad assets into a bad bank and get out of the investment banking business, in favor of concentrating on transaction banking. Some of the problematic transactions being investigated have to with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, another thing the President has to worry about. Facebook Libra bad for Bank Stocks Speaking of bad banks, Facebook’s (NASDAQ:FB) new Libra cryptocurrency is particularly bad news for transaction banking, provided that banking regulatory authorities allow the project to go forward. Since the crypto will be backed by a basket of government fiat currencies, the price will be much more stable relative to these currencies than bitcoin (BTC-USD) is currently. Facebook will eventually allow libra to be transferred between people on the social networks, and since the Libra would represent currencies, it can earn a yield, allowing Facebook to become a de facto at much lower transaction costs, displacing the business of many a big bank.

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 31/05/19," Bitcoin slid by 4.72% on Thursday. Following on from a 0.69% fall on Wednesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $8,270. A 3rd consecutive day in the red left Bitcoin down by 5.27% for the current week. While the bears look to take back control, the bulls delivered in the month of May. Bitcoin was up by 47.7% for the current month. On the day, a relatively bullish morning saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $8,537.5 to a high $8,819.7 before easing back to $8,700 levels. An early afternoon rally saw Bitcoin strike an intraday high and new swing hi $9,109.0. Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $8,831.33 and second major resistance level at $8,984.67 before hitting reverse. A broad-based crypto sell-off saw Bitcoin slide to a late intraday low $8,005 before finding support. The reversal saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level at $8,489.83 and second major support level at $8,301.67. Key on the day was a hold onto $8,000 levels, though Bitcoin was unable to break back through the support levels by the day end. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red on the day, with even Binance Coin unable to buck the trend. Leading the way down was Bitcoin Cash SV, which tumbled by 11.68%. The reversal barely made a dent into the current month gains, with Bitcoin Cash SV up by 74.2% for May. EOS and Bitcoin Cash ABC also saw heavy losses, the pair down by 8.95% and 7.79% on the day. The Thursday reversal left the majors split for the current week. While Bitcoin Cash SV led the way, EOS (+4.81%) and Ripple’s XRP (+2.28%) were the only other majors in positive territory for the week. Leading the way down were Binance Coin and Bitcoin, with losses of 5.6% and 5.3% respectively. In spite of the mixed performance in the week, it’s been a particularly bullish month, however. Leading the charge was Bitcoin Cash SV, which surged by 240% through the current month. Bitcoin Cash ABC came in a distant second, up by 60%. Trailing the pack with relatively minor gains were Stellar’s Lumen (20.98%) and Ripple’s XRP (28.88%). Having hit a week high $286.55bn on Thursday, the total crypto market cap fell back to $258bn levels off the back of Thursday’s afternoon sell-off. In spite of the slide, 24-hour volumes have returned to $100bn levels at the time of writing, though this time around investors are looking to lock in profits. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.53% to $8,143.1. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to a morning high $8,367 before sliding to a morning low $8,142.6. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested in the early hours. Elsewhere, it was red across the board for the crypto top 10. Leading the way down were Binance Coin (-3.31%), Ethereum (-3.28%) and Bitcoin Cash SV (-3.24%).  For the Day Ahead, Bitcoin would need to move back through the morning high $8,367 to $8,460 levels to support a recovery of Thursday’s losses. Sentiment across the broader market would need to materially improve, however, for Bitcoin to recover the early losses. In the event of a cryptomarket rebound, a move through to $8,460 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $8,917.7 into play. Failure to move back through the morning high $8,367 would see Bitcoin sit in the red through the day. A slide through to Thursday’s low $8,005 would bring sub-$8.000 levels into play before any recovery. Barring another crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin would likely steer clear of the first major support level at $7,813.67.

The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 19/06/19," Bitcoin slid by 2.75% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 4.1% gain from Monday, Bitcoin ended the day at $9,095.0. A relatively choppy day saw Bitcoin slide from a start of a day intraday high $9,376.8 to a late intraday low $8,945.0. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $9,063.47. Support from the broader market led to a final hour recovery to $9,000 levels. The Tuesday sell-off brought to an end a run of 6 consecutive days in the green. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was another mixed bag for the major cryptos. Binance Coin and Litecoin bucked the trend on the day. While Litecoin eked out a 0.67% gain, Binance Coin rose by 1.45%. The rest of the pack saw red. Leading the way down was Stellar’s Lumen, which slid by 5.48%. EOS (-5.13%), Ripple’s XRP (-4.83%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-4.48%) were not far behind on the day. The reversal on the day came in spite of a lack of news events, with the Bitcoin bulls continuing to grab the headlines. News of Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra also did the rounds on the day, but would unlikely have had any material influence. The jury is still out on whether Facebook will be able to successfully launch a cryptocurrency and compete with the likes of Bitcoin. In spite of the Tuesday reversal, the total crypto market cap avoided a pullback to sub-$280bn levels. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $283.6bn. Trading volumes eased back, however, falling back from $75bn levels on Sunday to sub-$60bn levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.69% to $9,157.5. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from an early morning low $9,062.0 to a high $9,198.0. In spite of the early moves, Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin bucked the trend early, with declines of $1.24% and 0.58% respectively. Leading the pack at the time of writing was Bitcoin. Binance Coin was close behind, up by 0.53%. Bitcoin would need to avoid a pullback to sub-$9,140 levels through the day to support a move back through to $9,300 levels. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break through the first major resistance level at $9,332.87. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could take a run at Sunday’s high $9,490 and $9,500 levels before any pullback. Failure to steer clear of sub-$9,140 levels could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall back through the morning low $9,062.0 would bring sub-$9,000 levels into play. A broad-based crypto sell-off would likely see Bitcoin test the first major support level at $8,901.07 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$8,900 levels on the day. For those looking to see if there’s any correlation between the cryptos and monetary policy, today could be the day. With the FED expected to signal monetary policy easing later in the year will a more dovish FED deliver a boost to the majors?

Jamie Dimon has questions about Facebook's cryptocurrency," In February, JPMorgan Chase briefly excited bitcoin enthusiasts when it launched its own cryptocurrency, JPM Coin. But soon after the announcement, the crypto community and tech media aptly pointed out that JPM Coin is an internal token for settling transactions with JPM clients, permissioned rather than “permissionless,” and fully controlled by JPMorgan (JPM)—not so exciting to crypto flag-wavers. In the days since June 18, Facebook (FB) has had a somewhat similar experience. The embattled tech giant announced it would launch in 2020 a new cryptocurrency called Libra (in partnership with a collection of big-name “founding members” including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, eBay, Uber, and Lyft) and a digital wallet called Calibra. While some analysts and research firms are bullish that Libra can bring cryptocurrency mainstream, the cryptocurrency industry mostly has questions and criticism, like whether Libra coin can be truly decentralized when Facebook execs are building it, and whether Libra’s blockchain can ever be truly open and public when there’s a carefully-selected roundtable of “members” behind it. UBS, in a note on Libra, declared, “We have more questions than answers.” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also has questions. “Will they follow banking rules or KYC, BSA, AML,” Dimon said in an interview with Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer, “or will they not? But they obviously want to serve their clients, and that’s fine. I also want to be able to serve their clients, too. We would like to do some of it too, ourselves, and we don’t always want to be forced into someone else’s ecosystem.” Questions about Libra’s plan for KYC/AML Dimon is referring to “know your customer” rules (KYC) and “anti-money laundering” (AML) rules, which stem from the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA). Any U.S. bank or financial service company holding and transmitting money on behalf of customers is required to comply with KYC and with BSA/AML. And Dimon is right to point to those acronyms; other critics have also picked up on the fact that Libra’s white paper makes no mention of KYC, and just one mention of AML (bolding ours): “The existing blockchain systems have yet to reach mainstream adoption... Some projects have also aimed to disrupt the existing system and bypass regulation as opposed to innovating on compliance and regulatory fronts to improve the effectiveness of anti-money laundering. We believe that collaborating and innovating with the financial sector, including regulators and experts across a variety of industries, is the only way to ensure that a sustainable, secure and trusted framework underpins this new system.”   Facebook Libra coin don't need KYC. They have so much more data on the 2 billion people. Not just name, id, address, phone number. They know your family, friends, real-time/historic location, what you like... They know you more than yourself. And now your wallet too. Best AML! Instead of harping on KYC and AML, Facebook emphasizes, in multiple sections of the Libra website and the Calibra press release, that it will keep Libra customers’ financial data separate from Facebook social data. But that doesn’t really address the regulatory concerns Dimon is talking about. Jamie Dimon: ‘Blockchain is real’ Nonetheless, Dimon sounds a lot more bullish on crypto and blockchain than he did when he called bitcoin a “fraud worse than tulip bulbs” in 2017. “Blockchain is real. We have the JPMorgan coin blockchain. And competition is real,” Dimon told Yahoo Finance. But he also thinks the banking system doesn’t really need cryptocurrency. “The banking system has already built Zelle, realtime P2P, and TCH The Clearing House,” Dimon says. “We already have all that. And it’s very cheap, it’s very secure, it shares a lot of information. It goes through all the bank security systems, cybersecurity systems, KYC, BSA, AML. We’re going to have competitors... whether it’s a cryptocurrency competitor or another fintech competitor, we’re going to have competitors. I tell our people, Just don’t guess. You know they’re there. You know they’re coming. You know they want to eat your lunch. Assume it. And it might not be the ones we see. It might be the ones we don’t see.” Facebook is very clearly one of the tech competitors that would like to eat JPMorgan’s lunch—Zuckerberg reportedly has long had ambitions of Facebook getting into banking. Libra appears to be the manifestation of those ambitions, but whether it will catch on with mainstream consumers is far from a given—even with 2.4 billion global users. — Daniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

Bitcoin looks to find five-figure support to confirm new bull run," Bitcoin may finally be back in a confirmed bull market after experiencing huge volatility as it looks to find support around $12,000. Following a near four-fold valuation increase since its bear market lows of late 2018, the digital asset hit nearly $14,000 yesterday before the market traded down more than $2,000 to $11,800 and then $11,400 this morning. First network effect: speculation. Human behavior very difficult to change. Bitcoin acts like both Giffin (TX fees) & Veblen (SOV) goods. Time to buy $BTC is @TIPMayerMultple less than 0.8. Now 2.4. Only few months ago Mayer Multiple of 0.5-0.65. Easy peasy. Got #Bitcoin? 😎 pic.twitter.com/yG0sGTyssO — Trace Mayer (@TraceMayer) June 27, 2019  After the initial sell-off, Bitcoin recovered over $1,500 to trade as high as $13,300 before falling back down for its first clear ‘lower low’ in over a week. The second push down seemed to have less momentum and the market has since bounced back above the significant level of $12,000. The move up was driven by spectacular trading volume, with Messari recording over $5.5 billion on its ‘Real 10’ index. Margin trading platform BitMEX also saw record highs with over $11 billion traded on its XBT/USD perpetual swap contract, which is currently holding over $1 billion in open interest and charging funding of up to 1% a day. XBTUSD perp swap open interest is now in the 3 comma club. Welcome to the 2019 bull fucking market YeeHaw! pic.twitter.com/rLhKRIn83d — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 26, 2019  Bitcoin’s market dominance is also up to 62% – a level last seen at the pinnacle of its 2017 bull run to $20,000. After smashing through initially $10,000 and then $12,000 at the first time of asking, Bitcoin made potentially its first FOMO high of its newly established bull market since bottoming in December of last year at $3,100. Following this latest parabolic run of nearly $5,000 (from $9,000 to $14,000), the world’s biggest digital asset has fallen back to see if new buyers can provide support to sustain a five-figure valuation. Looking at the 12-hour chart, we can see potential short-term indecision forming a ‘Neutral-Doji‘ candle. Before the FOMO top, Bitcoin established a run of seven consecutive green 12-hourly candles, with just three red periods over an eight-day parabolic run of 55% gains. Bitcoin is currently trying to establish support at a level of resistance that has rejected a Bitcoin bull market twice – in February and March of 2018. During this time, Bitcoin made a sequence of lower highs of first $11,771 and then $11,683 a few weeks later before heading into a 10-month period of lower highs and continuous retesting of support around $6,000. The support famously broke down to confirm the bear market in November 2018. Since then, many altcoins that are attempting to grow a community and create scarcity have seen huge increases in the worth of their tokens. An example of this is the Binance token BNB, which has soared to all-time high prices (eclipsing even its 2017 bull run high) to trade up to its current $4.5 billion valuation. Bitcoin vs global aggregate negative yielding sovereign debt. Real straightforward situation. pic.twitter.com/Obmhnkbrf7 — Travis Kling (@Travis_Kling) June 27, 2019  Just days before a showdown between China and the USA at this weekend’s G20 summit, Bitcoin is rallying in tandem with the negative-yielding sovereign debt. Although sometimes hard to imagine (yes, someone does actually pay you to borrow money), this type of value proposition comes down to the fact that the debt is pegged to a local fiat currency that is ‘forecast’ to devalue faster than a so-called stable currency (like the US dollar) over the maturity period of the ‘sovereign note’. Bitcoin is now under a year away from its next key technical event, which will be the first time the asset is truly watched (and checked) by all as its supply is cut in half from 12.5 to 6.25 Bitcoins every block. The concept of digital scarcity can sometimes be hard to truly fathom. However, once understood, it could lead to the establishment of a new monetary union based on the principles of transparency and immutability in fair and free-market commerce. Of all the globally-traded and liquid digital assets available today, only Bitcoin looks to have the credentials and track record to fulfill this infant concept.

," It’s been a bullish first half of the week. Following last week’s 14.6% rally, Ethereum was up by 2.62%, Sunday through Tuesday. A bearish start to the week saw Ethereum fall to an early Monday current week low $296.68 before finding support. Steering well clear of the first major support level at $274.48, Ethereum rallied to a Tuesday high $317.4. In spite of 3 consecutive days in the green, Ethereum came up short of the first major resistance level at $329.02. Following a 66.9% rally in May, Ethereum was up by 18.3%. After a choppy start to the month, Ethereum managed to recover from a fall back through the 23.6% FIB of $257 to a June low $226.56. The extended bearish trend, formed at last May 2018’s swing hi $828.97, remained firmly intact, however. Ethereum continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $367, following December’s swing lo $80.6. For the bulls, a breakout from the 38.2% FIB of $367 would be needed to form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 5% to $332.43. The Wednesday morning rally saw Ethereum break through the first major resistance level at $329.02 to a current week high $339.0. A move back through the Wednesday morning current week high $339.0 would support a run at $350 levels. Ethereum would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from $340 levels. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, a breakthrough the second major resistance level at $349.55 would bring the 38.2% FIB of $367 into view. A hold above the first major resistance level at $329.02 would be key mid-week. A Bitcoin break through to $13,000 levels would give Ethereum momentum through the latter part of the week. For the current week, however, we would expect Ethereum to come up short of $360 levels. Failure to move back through the current week high $339.0 could see Ethereum give up some of the current week gains. A fall through to sub-$325 levels could see Ethereum pullback to $315 levels before any recovery. Barring a broad-based sell-off in the 2nd half of the week, however, Ethereum should steer well clear of the first major support level at $274.48. In the event of a broad-based crypto reversal, Ethereum could visit $280 levels before any recovery. Major Support Level: $274.48 Major Resistance Level: $329.02 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $257 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $367 62% FIB Retracement Level: $543 This article was originally posted on FX Empire",Bob Mason,FX Empire,2019-06-26T09:42:06.000Z
," If you’ve been following the most recent price action in the crypto markets, you’re probably wondering what’s going to happen within the next couple of weeks – especially if you’re holding some altcoins. Will the bull market be kind to the majority of cryptos like in 2017? Or will we see a sudden drop in interest around altcoins as Bitcoin’s market dominance continues to rise? Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market underwent a sharp correction on Sunday, knocking more than $20 billion off the total market capitalisation in less than 24 hours. The pullback followed a brief period of consolidation that saw Bitcoin struggle to get back above the $12,000 mark. All of the top-20 coins reported losses on Sunday, with Bitcoin falling 6.9% to $11,155, according to TradingView. With the reversal, Bitcoin’s market cap has slipped back below $200 billion for the first time since last Thursday. Even though many cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors are still hoping for an altcoin bull season, the data shows that BTC market dominance is once again on the rise – and it is showing no signs of slowing down. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s market dominance is sitting close to 65%. What this shows us is that investors have been betting heavily on Bitcoin and are not so sure about altcoins – even major ones. Apart from Litecoin and Binance Coin, most of the top-10 cryptocurrencies have been underperforming against Bitcoin during 2019. It seems some lessons have been learned from the ICO craze of 2017/18. Of course, we now have the rise of IEOs, which aim to “disrupt” how cryptocurrency projects raise funds by giving the gatekeeping power to exchanges – entities that have proven time and time again to be untrustworthy. My guess is that Bitcoin market dominance will keep rising until it breaks new all-time highs. There is little evidence that shows an opposite path developing ahead, as most institutional investment is focusing on Bitcoin. There are a couple of things I would like to focus on in this graph. First, let’s take a look at that beautiful pink trend line that started at the top of the bull market in early 2018 and is still going today. What this shows is that bear markets are extremely painful for altcoin holders – but that is not news. More interestingly, we can see there’s a trend for Bitcoin to keep gaining dominance past 70%. If what I believe is correct and Bitcoin dominance grows another 10% before it stabilises, what will happen to altcoins? Well, for starters, I believe most will never recover. The ones that do will moon past previous highs as well. Another interesting indicator is the volume profile on the left, which shows us that Bitcoin’s dominance just crossed an important level: 60% dominance. This level had the most volume both from Bitcoin buyers and sellers. Now that volumes are super thin, I expect Bitcoin to reach $20,000 by the end of the year, and when price plateaus, new entrants will look toward altcoins for gains. We can’t forget that one of the most important drivers of human behaviour is greed. FOMO is what pumps price past previous highs and is what brings new people into the market. Despite everyone, or mostly everyone, saying volatility is bad for Bitcoin and for the cryptocurrency market in general, they seem to forget that without great volatility, there’s no room for huge price swings. And what attracts traders and new entrants the most? Precisely. Bitcoin dominance is clearly on the rise, and it will keep going until it reaches a maximum of 80%. I believe that will happen close to the top of the current bull cycle, and afterwards we’ll see investors and traders switching to altcoins for gains. If you want to get into the market, look at the top performers of 2019, like Litecoin (LTC) and Binance Coin (BNB), and think of what will happen to those coins when Bitcoin dominance declines. I’m pretty confident their prices will go berserk and power past previous highs. Safe trades!

"KuCoin launches derivatives trading platform KuMEX, promises up to 20x leverage"," Count this as the latest attempt by a cryptocurrency exchange to take a piece of the perpetual swap pie. IDG-backed KuCoin has announced the beta launch of its derivatives trading platform, KuMEX. To start, the new platform will offer trading of its so-called Bitcoin Perpetual Contract (XBTUSDM).  KuCoin is the latest cryptocurrency exchange to announce its intention to gatecrash the market for cryptocurrency derivatives, a space currently dominated by behemoth BitMEX. Houbi, Binance, and Bitfinex have recently launched or announced the impending launch of their own platforms to trade perpetual swaps, a synthetic way to bet on cryptocurrencies.  As part of its attempt to lure traders to the new venue, KuMEX will offer rebates to certain traders. “At the same time, KuMEX offers a negative fee for Makers at a rate of -0.025% with a certain amount of fixed commission, encouraging users to provide liquidity to the platform through making the market and earning some commission as an incentive,” the press release reads. Furthermore, the platform uses Bitcoin Spot Index that volume-weights the price of bitcoin in six major exchanges—Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, Liquid and Bittrex. According to the press release, by using figures from more exchanges, KuMEX hopes to achieve a more “fair and rigorous” bitcoin index price. Meanwhile, rival BitMEX prices its swaps based on data from a pool of three exchanges.  KuCoin also announced a trading competition, with a reward of 10,000 KCS for users with top scores in their return rate ranking.",Carol Gaszcz,The Block,2019-07-08T14:47:12.000Z
742," Warren Buffett has called cryptocurrency a “gambling device” with “a lot of fraud,” and declared, “That is not investing.” Justin Sun is going to attempt to change Buffett’s mind. Sun, cofounder and CEO of the cryptocurrency project Tron, bid $4.56 million in the annual eBay charity auction earlier this month to win lunch with Buffett. Sun has not shared when the lunch will take place, but tweeted on Monday that he has confirmed the lunch with Buffett. The location will be Smith & Wollensky in New York City, and Sun can bring seven friends to join. On Monday, Sun told Yahoo Finance his goal for the lunch: “We want this lunch to be a bridge between the cryptocurrency community and the traditional investor.” That’s a tall order. And Sun knows it. “It might be unrealistic to convince Warren Buffett, just in three hours, to buy cryptocurrencies,” Sun says. “But we want to show him the recent progress of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. It’s not only about Tron itself, it’s about crypto and blockchain, the whole industry.” Sun adds that he is a “long-time believer” in Buffett’s value investing strategy, and, he says, “I’ve made lots of money from these strategies. So this is like a payback to Warren Buffett.” Sun also liked that the charity, Glide Foundation, is based in San Francisco. But some may find irony in how Sun paid the $4.56 million: with ad revenue from BitTorrent, the peer-to-peer file sharing company Sun bought last year for $140 million. BitTorrent, Sun acknowledges, “has nothing to do with cryptocurrency.” Tron is one of the more controversial of the top crypto projects. It was originally pitched as a blockchain platform for the entertainment industry, but its cryptocurrency Tronix (TRX) is currently mostly used for sports gambling. Sun still says he has clear ambition for Tron: “Our mission is to decentralize the internet.” In addition to running the Tron Foundation, Sun is CEO of Peiwo, a Chinese social platform built around voice recognition. He was also an early investor in Tesla; he drew heavy scrutiny last month when he announced a Tesla giveaway and then appeared to rescind the offer. Sun graduated from Hupan University, the school Alibaba cofounder Jack Ma established in 2015 in Hangzhou, and he calls himself a “protege” of Jack Ma. As of Monday, Tronix is the No. 11 cryptocurrency by market cap. The price is up 55% in 2019, while bitcoin is up more than 100%. — Daniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

Ethereum Analysis – Resistance Levels in Play – 26/06/19," It’s been a bullish first half of the week. Following last week’s 14.6% rally, Ethereum was up by 2.62%, Sunday through Tuesday. A bearish start to the week saw Ethereum fall to an early Monday current week low $296.68 before finding support. Steering well clear of the first major support level at $274.48, Ethereum rallied to a Tuesday high $317.4. In spite of 3 consecutive days in the green, Ethereum came up short of the first major resistance level at $329.02. Following a 66.9% rally in May, Ethereum was up by 18.3%. After a choppy start to the month, Ethereum managed to recover from a fall back through the 23.6% FIB of $257 to a June low $226.56. The extended bearish trend, formed at last May 2018’s swing hi $828.97, remained firmly intact, however. Ethereum continued to fall short of the 38.2% FIB Retracement Level of $367, following December’s swing lo $80.6. For the bulls, a breakout from the 38.2% FIB of $367 would be needed to form a near-term bullish trend. At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 5% to $332.43. The Wednesday morning rally saw Ethereum break through the first major resistance level at $329.02 to a current week high $339.0. A move back through the Wednesday morning current week high $339.0 would support a run at $350 levels. Ethereum would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from $340 levels. In the event of a broad-based crypto rebound, a breakthrough the second major resistance level at $349.55 would bring the 38.2% FIB of $367 into view. A hold above the first major resistance level at $329.02 would be key mid-week. A Bitcoin break through to $13,000 levels would give Ethereum momentum through the latter part of the week. For the current week, however, we would expect Ethereum to come up short of $360 levels. Failure to move back through the current week high $339.0 could see Ethereum give up some of the current week gains. A fall through to sub-$325 levels could see Ethereum pullback to $315 levels before any recovery. Barring a broad-based sell-off in the 2nd half of the week, however, Ethereum should steer well clear of the first major support level at $274.48. In the event of a broad-based crypto reversal, Ethereum could visit $280 levels before any recovery. Major Support Level: $274.48 Major Resistance Level: $329.02 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $257 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $367 62% FIB Retracement Level: $543 This article was originally posted on FX Empire",Bob Mason,FX Empire,2019-06-26T09:42:06.000Z
," Binance Coin fell by 6.28% in the week ending 29th June. Partially reversing a 14.8% rally from the previous week, Binance Coin ended the week at $35.38. A bearish start to the week saw Binance Coin fall from a Sunday high $40.89 to a Wednesday low $32.77 before finding support. 3-days in the red out of 4 saw Binance Coin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $34, whilst steering clear of the major support levels. On a particularly choppy Wednesday, Binance Coin struck an intraweek high $42.91, while also falling to sub-$30 levels. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $43.48, Binance Coin slipped through the first major support level at $31.79. In almost a repeat, Binance Coin returned to $42 levels on Thursday before falling to an intraweek low $27.03. Binance Coin fell back through the 23.6% FIB and first major support level before finding support. Two consecutive days in the green at the end of the week led to a move back through the 23.6% FIB to $35 levels. A move back through to $35 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $43.18. Binance Coin would need support from the broader market, however, to break through to $40 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, last week’s high $42.91 would likely pin Binance Coin back on the week. Failure to move back through to $35 levels could see Binance Coin give up more ground in the week. A fall through to $31 levels would bring the first major support level at $27.30 into play before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off through the week, Binance Coin should steer clear of sub-$20 support levels. At the time of writing, Binance Coin was down by 1.69% to $34.78. EOS tumbled by 15.65% in the week ending 29th June. Reversing an 8.59% rally form the previous week, EOS ended the week at $6.3347. Bearish through most of the week, EOS fell from a Sunday intraweek high $7.6435 to a Thursday intraweek low $5.5500. Falling short of the major resistance levels, Binance Coin slid through the first major support level at $6.8957 and second major support level at $6.2813. Of greater significance was a fall through the 23.6% FIB to visit sub-$6.00 levels for the first time since 6th June. Partially reversing five consecutive days in the red, EOS saw green for the final 2-days of the week to return to $6.3 levels. EOS would need to move through to $6.50 levels to support a partial recovery of last week’s losses. A move through the 23.6% FIB of $6.62 to $6.80 levels would support a run at the first major resistance at $7.4688. EOS would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the 23.6% FIB of $6.62. Failure to move through to $6.50 levels could see EOS fall deeper into the red. A slide through to sub-$6.00 levels would bring the first major support level at $5.3753 into play. Barring another crypto meltdown, however, EOS should steer clear of sub-$4.00 support levels on the week. At the time of writing, EOS was down by 0.96% to $6.2739. Ethereum rose by 2.76% in the week ending 29th June. Following on from a 14.57% rally on from the previous week, Ethereum ended the week at $317.00. A bearish start to the week left Ethereum in the red on Sunday, 23rd June before making a move. Steering well clear of the major support levels, Ethereum rallied to a Wednesday intraweek high $364.49. The rally saw Ethereum break through the first major resistance level at $329.02 and second major resistance level at $349.55. Falling short of the 38.2% FIB of $367, Ethereum joined the rest of the majors in the red on Thursday. Ethereum pulled back through the resistance levels to an intraweek low $273.5. Steering clear of the first major support level at $272.17, Ethereum found support from the broader market to recover to $300 levels. A move through to $318 levels would support further upside in the week ahead. Ethereum would need to move through to $340 levels, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $363.16. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, last week’s high $364.49 and the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside on the week. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Ethereum could break through the 38.2% FIB of $367 to bring $400 levels into range. Failure to move through to $318 levels could see Ethereum hit reverse. A fall through to sub-$300 levels would bring the first major support level at $272.17 into play before any recovery. Barring a Bitcoin meltdown, Ethereum should steer clear of the 23.6% FIB of $257.

Why Facebook's crypto push won't be a 'major game-changer': Analyst," Don’t expect unbridled enthusiasm over Facebook’s reported cryptocurrency push just yet. “I don’t believe it’s going to be this kind of major game-changer,” Brent Thill, Jefferies senior technology analyst, tells Yahoo Finance’s “The Ticker.” “We’re still stuck in the way we use the current currencies. And I think anyone that’s shopped on Instagram today realizes using PayPal is pretty easy. You have two clicks of your thumb and you’ve got a product on the way within a day.” According to the Wall Street Journal, the tech giant has support from big names like Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and Uber Technologies (UBER) for the project. Over a dozen companies will reportedly invest roughly $10 million each in an association that will oversee the digital currency, called Libra. This comes as RBC analyst Mark Mahaney forecasts in a recent note that Facebook’s (FB) cryptocurrency strategy could be “one of the most important initiatives in the history of the company to unlock new engagement and revenue streams.” For his part, Thill predicts Facebook backing the digital coin will give it more credibility, but it will take some time for users to adapt. “I think all the internet companies are trying to figure out payments. It’s a huge, huge pain point,” he said. Facebook is planning to unveil its cryptocurrency on Tuesday, according to TechCrunch. McKenzie Stratigopoulos is a producer at Yahoo Finance.

The Top 5 cryptocurrencies latest price," Today the price of Bitcoin is US$$11,158.25; Ethereum is US$290.43; XRP is US$0.389770; Bitcoin Cash is US$401.86 and Litecoin is US$119.90. These are the Top 5 cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. The top 5 cryptocurrencies are the biggest and most significant cryptocurrencies and constitute the top half of The Top 10 Cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation. In August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are. The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without “relying on trust”. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number “0” (or the “genesis block”) which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) developed by the Ripple company. It is also referred to as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol. It can trace its roots to 2004 when a web developer called Ryan Fugger had the idea to create a monetary system that was decentralised and could effectively allow individuals to create their own money. Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on 30th July 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a white paper in 2013 describing Ethereum. Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn’t get buy-in to his proposal. Bitcoin Cash was born out of the idea of making Bitcoin more practical for small, day-to-day payments. In May 2017, Bitcoin payments took about four days unless a fee was paid, which was proportionately too large for small transactions. A change to the code was implemented and Bitcoin Cash was born on 1st August 2017. Litecoin was released in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee. It was a fork of Bitcoin with the main difference being a smaller block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, and a different script-based algorithm.

Binance announces futures trading platform with up to 20x leverage," Binance, the largest crypto-to-crypto exchange, announced that it will launch a futures trading platform, dubbed Binance Futures, in the coming months. Speaking at Asia Blockchain Summit in Taipei, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that Binance Futures will initially support BTC/USDT futures with up to 20x leverage but that the platform is eventually expected to support more pairs as well as higher leverage. Bitfinex also recently announced that it is ready to ship a derivatives product with up to 100x leverage. BitMEX also offers a similar product with up to 100x leverage on its Bitcoin perpetual swap contract. Binance is currently in the process of rolling out its margin trading offering, joining several other crypto exchanges (Bitfinex, Poloniex, Huobi, Kraken) that support margin already. ",Frank Chaparro,The Block,2019-07-02T08:31:15.000Z
," Last week, when I wrote my usual Monday BTC price analysis, Bitcoin was trading close to $9,200. At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading just below $11,000 after price climbed 16% from $9,200 to $11,070 in just a couple of days. It seems the hypothesis that weekends are good for Bitcoin is indeed true, as BTC consolidated above the key $11,000 level during Saturday and Sunday before a dip going into Monday morning. My gut tells me this is what we’ve all been waiting for. Will Bitcoin maintain its weekend gains during the next few weeks? Has the bull market officially begun? Bitcoin has experienced a major rally that has taken its price upwards close to 34% over the past two weeks. Even with minor retracements, the market is moving positively with higher lows each time it falls, meaning we should expect BTC to continue its climb towards $13,000 – which in my opinion might come within the next couple of weeks. Last week, I mentioned how I was expecting BTC to break and hold above $10,000, which has come to fruition. While I personally am still bullish, others are predicting a sudden correction. Prominent Bitcoin trader davincij15 has claimed all bull markets are expected to suffer large corrections of around 30-35% of the total highs in the early stages. This means we could still see Bitcoin touching its 100-day EMA or even its 200-day EMA despite the bull cycle (which can last a couple of years). We’ve seen similar movements during previous cycles in 2013 and 2016-2017. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal, I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Corrections are expected and welcomed so that we can accumulate even during bull seasons. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past two weeks, volume has gone from $17 billion to $23 billion, consolidating now around $20 billion. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $15,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Of course, if you think I might be overreacting to positive news, you can always check what other expert analysts have to say about this recent price movement. Hopefully, the market will continue this positive momentum. Pay attention to retracements back down towards the 200-day EMA to make new entries. Safe trades!

3," On the daily time-frame the ascending trend of the XRP has “stumbled over” a long-term resistance line. After a divergence formed on MACD, the price started declining until it broke through the local support line. It might imply further decline up to the long-term support line around 0.2990. Resistance line should be marked at 0.4785; breaking through this line will signal the start of a stable ascending trend. On H4 the XRP tries to take hold at the lower projected channel. The short-term goal of the decline is the support area around 0.3525. Bearing in mind the Stochastic in the overbought area, a drop to 0.3980 is possible after reaching the local goal. The financial world is not ready for new solutions, says Technical Director of Ripple David Schwartz in his interview to CB Insights. He states that the technical solutions by Ripple, such as xRapid and xCurrent, have solved the problem of inter-bank transactions, which was the major issue of the banking system SWIFT. However, banks are not too eager to implement new technologies, being conservative and slow by their nature. Schwartz says that new solutions for payment systems are aggressive, swift, mobile and oriented on accelerated target-hitting. It helps save the time and money. Banks will adopt the new schemes sooner or later, but they are not ready yet. The main problem is that the aspects of market regulation are not thoroughly worked out yet, so the bank ecosystem does not feel completely protected, which is understandable. At the same the very nature of digital assets and blockchain-based approaches is still immature, which also prevents banks from implementing modern technologies. This year the XRP is rising in price slower than the leading currency BTC or other altcoins. It might be due to investors waiting for stronger fundamental catalysts that will provide for long-term rise of the XRP.

," Coinbase has become one of the largest exchanges in the world. Based in the US and operating since 2011, the exchange is often the first place many people go to buy their first ever Bitcoin. Coinbase provides many benefits such as simplicity of use, but it has also received criticism from Bitcoiners as well as many of its customers. Let’s take a look at four things you should know about Coinbase. One of the key benefits of using Coinbase is that it has a simple user interface that is ideal for people who have very little knowledge of the cryptocurrency scene. You can buy and store four of the major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. The signup process follows traditional financial technologies and includes a fairly stringent know your customer (KYC) process. While many traditional Bitcoiners feel uncomfortable handing over their personal details, it is the price of having a regulated exchange. Coinbase is based in the US and is fully regulated. This provides a sense of security for its users. The exchange also holds 2% of cryptocurrency storage online with the rest stored in offline wallets for additional safety. It is insured for any losses to the cryptocurrencies stored online. Coinbase is available in 107 countries throughout the world. However, there are limitations depending on the regulations of the specific country. Payment methods can also vary depending on your location. For those based in the UK, you can top up your Coinbase account with Sterling via debit or credit card, UK bank transfer, or SEPA. The ability to buy cryptocurrency with a variety of payment methods is one of the most attractive aspects of using Coinbase. Many other exchanges, especially those that provide the possibility of converting Bitcoin into altcoins, do not provide such a service. Therefore, if a user would like to trade in altcoins, they often buy Bitcoin from Coinbase first and transfer it over to the necessary exchange. One of the major issues that customers have complained about when using Coinbase is its customer support. On the review site Trustpilot, Coinbase has a 1-star rating. There is a general trend from the reviews left on the site. The first major issue is that the customer support is slow to respond to queries. This is especially problematic when Coinbase can be holding large amounts of a customer’s cryptocurrency, causing distress to the customer. Another issue highlighted by customers of Coinbase is the scripted nature of its customer support. Users have accused Coinbase of making its customer support robotic, making people think the exchange doesn’t care about their issues. The third issue that often appears on reviews for Coinbase is criticism of its referral program. By introducing friends to the service, you can be rewarded with better fees or coins. Yet many people have claimed on Trustpilot that they didn’t receive their rewards for doing so. It should be noted though that as with all reviews, the trend shows that unhappy customers are always more likely to leave a review than happy customers. Another one of the major criticisms of Coinbase is that it charges high fees for its service. There are numerous exchanges that provide a similar service to Coinbase but with cheaper fees. However, thanks to its reputation as one of the largest and easiest exchanges to use, it appears that customers are non-plussed regarding the expensive fees on Coinbase. Despite the high fees, the fact that Coinbase is insured for online losses and has never been hacked (as of the time of writing) means that the high fees might be worth it for many. To be as secure as possible though, you should always keep your Bitcoin in a hardware wallet rather than trusting a third party online. Despite some criticism, Coinbase still remains the main site for new investors to buy Bitcoin. Thanks to its first-mover advantage in the market, the variety of payments possible, and its ease of use, the exchange has marketed itself as the go-to exchange in the space. However, there certainly seems to be room for improvement on the customer support side of the operation judging by the reviews on Trustpilot. But for many who have experience in cryptocurrencies, they will have likely moved on to other exchanges that provide more altcoins and offer much lower fees.   The post Coinbase review: Four things you should know appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Ross Chalmers,Coin Rivet,2019-06-14T11:00:48.000Z
4," Cross-asset correlations are still high, but they seem to be decreasing, according to new analysis by The Block.  A major issue for cryptocurrency investors is the inability to truly diversify their cryptocurrency holdings. When the price of one cryptocurrency falls, generally the majority of other cryptocurrencies will fall as well. The lack of uncorrelated permissionless cryptocurrencies has a negative effect on the creation of on-chain crypto-collateralized derivative markets with sufficient liquidity. In early January, The Block performed a similar analysis and found that cryptocurrency prices were highly correlated in 2018, with correlation growing substantially from 2017. In 2018, the most correlated cryptocurrency was Ethereum followed by Bitcoin while the least correlated was TRON.

"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 03/07/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC fell by 2.59% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 4.11% gain from Monday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $408.02. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall from an early intraday high $418.87 to a late morning intraday low $383.16. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the 23.6% FIB of $418 and the first major support level at $394.38. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin Cash ABC recovered to $400 levels to limit the loss on the day. In spite of the partial recovery, Bitcoin Cash ABC was unable to move back through the 23.6% FIB… At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 1.1% to $412.50. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $408.41 to a high $418.0. Whilst falling short of the first major resistance level at $423.54, the 23.6% FIB of $418 continued to limit progress. For the day ahead, Bitcoin Cash ABC would need to steer clear of sub-$410 levels to support another run at the first major resistance level at $423.54. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the 23.6% FIB of $418. An extended crypto rally through the day could see Bitcoin Cash ABC test the second major resistance level at $439.06. Failure to avoid sub-$410 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC slide back through to sub-$400 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, the first major support level at $387.87 should limit any downside on the day. Litecoin slid by 3.26% on Tuesday. Reversing a 0.42% gain from Monday with interest, Litecoin ended the day at $118.59. A particularly bearish morning saw Litecoin slide from an intraday high $123.41 to a mid-morning intraday low $111.2. The reversal saw Litecoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $117 and the first major support level at $114.94. Finding support through the afternoon, Litecoin managed a brief return to $120 levels before easing back. The 23.6% FIB proved to be the resistance line on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 1.63% to $120.52. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a morning low $118.54 to a high $123.16 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested and also held above the 23.6% FIB of $117. For the day ahead, a hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 through the morning would support a bullish day ahead. A move back through the morning high $123.16 would bring the first major resistance level at $124.27 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Litecoin would likely see any upside capped at $126 levels on the day. Failure to hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 could see Litecoin test the first major support level at $112.06 before any recovery. Barring a crypto sell-off later in the day, Litecoin should steer clear of sub-$110 support levels on the day. Ripple’s XRP fell by 1.98% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 3.4% gain from Monday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.39991. Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP fell from an early intraday high $0.41187 to a late morning intraday low $0.38414. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Ripple’s XRP fell through the first major support level at $0.3922. Recovery through the afternoon saw Ripple’s XRP return to $0.4040 levels before sliding back to sub-$0.40 levels. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 0.74% to $0.40288. Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP rose from a morning low $0.39989 to a high $0.40711 before easing back. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on and also fell short of the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164. For the day ahead, a hold onto $0.40 levels through the morning would support further gains later in the day. A move back through the morning high $0.40711 would bring the first major resistance level at $0.4131 into play. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to break through the 23.6 % FIB of $0.4164. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP would likely come up short of $0.42 levels on the day. Failure to move back through the morning high $0.40711 could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse. A fall through to sub-$0.40 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.3854 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ripple’s XRP should steer clear of sub-$0.38 support levels on the day.

26," Who needs the Fed? Economist Stephen Moore won't have a seat on the Federal Reserve after withdrawing his name from consideration. But in an email to Yahoo Finance on Tuesday, Moore confirms that he is in negotiations to join the team at Decentral. The story was first reported by Fox Business Network. “I've been just in the last few months really starting to study up on these cryptocurrencies, and what impact those will have on the government currencies,"" Moore said recently on Yahoo Finance's The Final Round. According to Fox Business Network, Decentral is a “crypto central bank,” guided by group of entrepreneurs led by Sam Kazemian. They’re hoping to create a way to help stabilize cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin had more than doubled this year, even before Facebook (FB) and its partners unveiled the white paper for Libra coin. Since the announcement, bitcoin is up another 22%. Bitcoin's comeback has even Fed Chair Jay Powell answering crypto questions at FOMC press conferences. “Digital currencies are in their infancy,” Powell warned. “There are potential benefits here, there are also potential risks.” Regarding the threat of crypto currencies replacing currencies backed by central banks, Powell said, “I think we’re a long way from that.” Like Powell, Moore sees the risks and the benefits for crypto and central banks. ""This represents a new challenge for central bankers that they now have competition from private currencies,” Moore said. “And I think on balance, it's a good thing. And the big question now will be whether the Fed and whether this SEC that come out of these futures trading corporation, whether they will start regulating these cryptocurrencies.” — Follow Jen on Twitter @jensaidit or Instagram @jenrogershere.

1," Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume, is issuing a bitcoin-backed token, the firm announced in a blog post on Monday. Named BTCB, the tokens are reportedly 100% backed by bitcoins held in a reserve address, and will be issued by the exchange's native blockchain network, Binance Chain. BTCB's launch is part of a larger move by the exchange to boost the selection of tokens available for trading on Binance DEX, Binance's recently-launched decentralized exchange. BTCBs will be available for trading via a BTCB/BTC trading pair on Binance's main platform, and can then be transferred to Binance DEX for trading. ""With the increase in the selection of tokens available on Binance DEX, there should be an increase in trading volume and liquidity, This would further increase the utility value of Binance DEX,"" the firm stated. There are plans to have multiple crypto-pegged tokens in the future.",Steven Zheng,The Block,2019-06-17T13:53:24.000Z
2," Switzerland Bans Trading of Swiss Stocks in EU Switzerland is having a row with the European Union, so it decided to ban trading of its stocks on EU exchanges. These include Novartis (NASDAQ:NVS), Nestle (OTCMKTS:NSRGF), and Roche (OTCMKTS:RHHBY) among others. Europe said it would no longer recognize Swiss stock markets as having the same status as those of EU members, so Switzerland ordered the EU exchanges to stop trading Swiss stocks in retribution. CNN is extrapolating that this disagreement has implications for Brexit, but that’s a stretch, given that trading must continue if the European economy is to maintain any semblance of integration and the politicians that get into these sorts of fights want to keep their tax revenues flowing. Sooner or later, probably sooner, new agreements will have to be sketched out by necessity and trading continued. Otherwise, investors will find other ways to buy and sell securities and the political class will be blamed for any losses. SEE: FSD Pharma Gets License to Sell Cannabis for Medical Use Bitcoin Continues To Collapse Bitcoin (BTC-USD) may not be storing value very well, but it sure is providing a lot of opportunities for short term traders to both make and lose a lot of money.  Daily trading volume continues to trend to new record highs, hitting a record $44 billion a day this month as the cryptocurrency appeared to have topped out for a second time since 2017, this time at around $13,775. So far we are down 28.3% in six days, matching the pace of the crash following the high of $20,001.50 reached on December 17, 2017. Six days later back then, Bitcoin had fallen below $12,800 but recovered somewhat until mid January when it began another fall to $9,600. The decline in Bitcoin is leading the decline in other cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) and Ethereum (ETH-USD) down less than half of Bitcoin’s decline over the last 24 hours. The downward momentum could be feeding on itself while attracting short sellers into the futures markets, meaning a short term bounce may be due, as it was during the last sharp decline at around this time following the last top. This, in turn, could further encourage more short term traders into the market, pushing daily trading volume even higher. As Bitcoin trading volume hits new records, more are using Bitcoin trading software to spot sentiment changes in order to capitalize on price changes. CEO of CryptoMiner Solutions had this to say of the current volatility, “’Buy the fear, sell the greed’ is the name of the trading game. Our auto trading software reflects this daily.” Easier said than done, though successful traders do add to overall price stability by buying low and selling high. USTR Wants More Tariffs on European, Olives, Cheese, Whiskey, because Airplanes If you like to eat pizza with olives from Europe while drinking whiskey and not paying any tariffs, then you’re in for some bad news. The US Trade Representative’s office has released a list of products, including all of the above, that could be hit with taxes in addition to the $21 billion in taxes that were already announced in April. The fight has to do with subsidies for Boeing (NYSE:BA), an American company, and Airbus (OTCMKTS:EADSY), a Dutch company, who both get subsidies from their respective governments, paid for buy their respective taxpayers. So, in order to “level the playing field” each government is threatening to burden their taxpayers even more with more taxes on totally unrelated foods and alcoholic drinks and fruits grown and produced by companies that have absolutely nothing to do with airplanes whatsoever. Talk about getting caught in a crossfire. Speaking of Boeing, 737 Grounding Keeps Dragging On Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) has thrown a monkey wrench in the engines of all 737s still grounded, though not literally, as it announced that it will remove all its 737s from its fleet until after October 1 at the earliest. Boeing had earlier estimated that the 737 fleet would be back in the air by September, so Boeing fell 2% on the news yesterday. Defending the move, Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told Fox, “Being proactive like this helps us reduce the last-minute cancellations and allows us to rebook our Customers well in advance, so that’s important that we continue to stay ahead of this.” Southwest has already removed 150 daily flights from its schedule. Hong Kongers Break Down Legislature Doors On the 12th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, Hong Kong residents chose to celebrate by bashing in the doors of the legislature and defacing the portraits of politicians who make laws there on behalf of the Communist Party of China. A Union Jack colonial flag, the flag of Hong Kong before it was handed over to China, was draped over the desk of the legislature’s president, and slogans were spray-painted across the building. Hong Kong stocks remain resilient, perhaps rooting for the protesters to keep China’s authorities at bay and maintain whatever is left of liberty on the island. Interestingly, the Hong Kong dollar, pegged to the US dollar, is up half a percent against the US dollar since June 10, a big move for a pegged currency.   The post Market Morning: Swiss Bans Stocks from EU, Bitcoin Breaks Below $10K, USTR Wants More Tariffs appeared first on Market Exclusive.",ME Staff,Market Exclusive,2019-07-02T13:13:37.000Z
3," Gold Wakes Up, Media Wakes Up To Gold Gold (NYSEARCA:GLD) is on the move, now above $1,400 an ounce for the first time since August 2013. Mainstream media is starting to pay more attention to the metal now, but still seems to keep to the basic script that gold goes up in times of uncertainty. “Gold has historically been a pocket of strength in periods where uncertainty increases sharply,” said CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell, quoted by CNN. Investors often flock to gold as a safe haven in times of increased volatility, CNN explains. The problem with these explanations are that they are simply untrue, but nobody seems to challenge them. The vast majority of the last bull market in gold, which began in 2001, occurred during the 2002-2007 bull market in stocks. This was not a period of volatility or uncertainty. Gold quadrupled over the time period from 2001 to 2008 after breaching $1,000 for the first time ever. It has now been basing for 10 years, after retracing a little less than 50% of its previous bull market. Trump Administration Rescue Iran From Trade Imbalances…Through Sanctions Meanwhile, the Trump Administration is looking to support the gold price, and help balance Iranian international trade. After calling off a military strike against Iran over the weekend and for some reason publicizing this story, President Trump has instead decided to increase economic sanctions against Iran, which probably won’t make them any happier or willing to cooperate with whatever Trump wants them to cooperate about.  The sanctions path, apparently is called the “diplomatic path” even though sanctions mean ringing a country and preventing imports from crossing, sort of like tariffs except it’s a move against another country rather than your own country. In that sense, perhaps Trump is trying to help Iran by balancing its trade deficit through sanctions. Meanwhile, Iran is already undergoing hyperinflation, with an annual inflation rate of 52%. OPEC Meet Next Week Critical for Oil Prices The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is meeting next week in what could help determine oil’s (NYSEARCA:USO) trajectory over the next few months. The cartel is aware that the world is expecting them to uphold the current production cut structure and perhaps even clamp down the pumps even harder as the Saudis try to prop up the oil price in preparation for yet another IPO attempt for Saudi Aramco, the most profitable company in the world, but not profitable enough for the appetites of Mohamed Bin Salman, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. Arguments could be made either way regarding the bullishness or bearishness of the continued trade war between the US and China on oil prices, bullish because it should push up consumer price inflation, which tends to bring oil prices up, and bearish because a weaker economy could push down the demand for oil. The dollar’s direction (NYSEARCA:UUP) should help determine which way oil is going to go assuming that OPEC keeps up with market expectations. Bitcoin Bear Market Rally Continues Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD) bear market rally continues over this weekend with prices breaching the $11,000 mark, and Ethereum (ETH-USD) breaching $300 for the first time in about a year. Trading volume in Ethereum and Bitcoin have reached all time highs since the current rally began last December. The next resistance zone for Bitcoin is around $11,500, and after that, there is no significant resistance until about $17,500, and then all time highs. So far though, this continues to be a bear market rally, until new highs are breached. McDonald’s Battles Minimum Wage With robots. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) branches in Chicago are testing out the ability of automatic fryers and voice activated drive-throughs  to take over from people, to, in their words “help increase production and shorten wait times” when in reality, it’s probably spurred on by higher minimum wage legislation and McDonald’s is trying primarily to save money. Employees are staring walkouts over these things, claiming that robots are going to take their jobs, which only becomes more probable if they walk out, as robots don’t have the ability to do this, making them easier to manage. Watch out for new legislation against automation, which, if it were a road taken in the 19th century, would have outlawed the industrial revolution, meaning many of these people now walking out of their jobs would never have existed in the first place.   The post Market Morning: Gold Awakens, More Iran Sanctions, Bitcoin Breaks Through, McDonald’s Goes Robots appeared first on Market Exclusive.",ME Staff,Market Exclusive,2019-06-24T11:00:19.000Z
1," The first Bitcoin was installed in Vancouver during 2013. But now the Mayor of the Canadian city is proposing a ban on the machines, arguing that they open the door to money laundering. It’s important to remember who exactly is using them; some of these people are often on society’s fringes, especially sex workers. Vancouver’s potential ban on such machines will affect that vulnerable group disproportionately, argues Ethan Lou, a former journalist who these days runs a mining company in Canada and whose first book, Once a Bitcoin Miner, will be published next year. In an article for The Globe and Mail, he says: “Make no mistake, the issue of Bitcoin ATMs is one of social class. Sex workers use cryptocurrency to buy ads or run websites because credit card issuers often refuse to work with the platforms and hosting services that cater to their industry. Using cryptocurrency also grants a certain anonymity, which is of particular importance; many sex workers deliberately avoid using online exchange platforms, which have lower fees, but often require bank accounts, credit cards, a fixed address or other identification.” What makes the ATMs attractive to sex workers is also attractive to money launderers, Lou concedes. “British Columbia has wide-ranging issues with dirty money and it is not a stretch to say the ATMs could be involved. But cleaning ill-gotten gains is almost as old as sex work. Are Bitcoin ATMs used more so than, or even as frequently as, restaurants, casinos, convenience stores or any other business?” Ultimately, those who launder money might end up little affected, he argues. With the right will and means, it is not hard to buy Bitcoin anonymously for cheaper than through ATMs. “As the City of Vancouver goes about its research, it is incumbent upon staff to at least consult the sex workers who, through no fault of their own, are caught in someone else’s fight, potentially made to suffer from someone else’s sins,” Lou concludes.

"Bitcoin Breaks Out, the Bull Market is in Full Swing"," Bitcoin prices topped $9,000 last week and put the token on track to move higher in the near-term. The move resulted in the breakdown of a significant resistance level that had been keeping prices in check. Now that resistance is broken down prices are likely to keep rising but just how far can they go? Simple technical targets based on the peaks set in 2018 suggest $10,000, $12,000, and $16,000 are logical targets. Projecting technical patterns like the run-up to, and subsequent break of resistance at $8,500 gives an equally optimistic target. The magnitude of that move is $5,300, projecting it from the $8,500 resistance line gives a target near $14,000. Momentum is slowing winding down but that is not a concern at this time. momentum remains firmly bullish and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. At current levels, the MACD histogram could take several months to wind down to zero and in that time BTC may have already surpassed its all-time highs. There are several factors driving the rally in Bitcoin. Yes, Facebook’s launch of Libra is helping to support prices but no, it isn’t really that important to Bitcoin other than as a sign of growing acceptance of blockchain technology. The two things that are driving Bitcoin’s price higher is next year’s scheduled halving and this summer’s launch of Bakkt physically-settled Bitcoin futures. The halving is an important event for Bitcoin as it will significantly reduce the number of available tokens. The halving is when the mining reward for Bitcoin is cut in half. After the halving, which occurs next May, each block will only be worth 6.5 Bitcoins. Because the cost of mining will remain the same this means the fundamental value of BTCs all over the world will increase. Bakkt and its launch of BTC futures are important for two reasons in and of itself. First, physically settled BTC futures will increase the volume of Bitcoin trading and that will aid its liquidity. Second, Bakkt is an SEC-approved trading venue. Now that it is cleared to test its futures products we are one step closer to a BTC ETF. The approval of a BTC ETF will be a game-changing event for Bitcoin. What we can expect from the price of Bitcoin over the next few months is this. A steady increase in prices punctuated by periodic tests of resistance and minor consolidations. This should continue up to and until BTC reaches its all-time high. Once BTC reaches its all-time high I see a flood of new money come into the market that may push it up to $50,000 within the next two years.

," Coin Rivet recently had the pleasure of catching up with Ethereum smart contracts developer Alice Henshaw. Alice spoke candidly to us about her love for computer security, the pitfalls of the private securities market, and motivating more women to enter the intimidating space of blockchain development. Could you tell us a bit about your own personal journey as a blockchain developer? I have been involved in the blockchain space for just over three years now in various ways. Currently, I am a blockchain developer focusing on development on the Ethereum blockchain, which I’ve been doing for the last 18 months or so. I am currently working for Fluidity (fluidity.io), where my day-to-day role involves developing smart contracts for Decentralised Finance (DeFi), alongside some research. Smart contracts are essentially programs which can be deployed onto certain blockchains, which are then executed in a decentralised way. What drew you into working on smart contracts? I started studying computer science and development at the age of 16, and immediately my favourite area was that of cryptography and security. At university, I studied computer science and chose a number of modules that focused on computer security. From there, smart contracts seemed like a natural progression for me. As a smart contract developer, you have to focus on the security of your contracts every single day – by publishing programs in such a public and decentralised way, and often using them to manage money, you’re almost asking people to try to hack them. This element of critical security brings together my love for computer security and blockchain. Currently it seems as though you are working on the tokenisation of securities. Why is this an important area to tackle? Blockchain provides a simple way to implement ownership and transferral of assets – much as you can transfer Bitcoins between individuals, you could transfer shares from one person to another. The current, traditional private securities markets are implemented in such a way that private securities are illiquid, inefficient, and inaccessible to the average investor. Tokenising these securities allows us to automate and massively simplify a number of the traditional processes, which ultimately has the potential to fix a number of issues. However, security tokens are still subject to the same regulations as traditional securities, meaning that all regulatory requirements must be outlined and implemented before any security can be tokenised. We are fast approaching a point where tokens are being created for just about anything, even if they do not serve a real purpose. From a developer’s point of view, how can we remedy this trend and ensure only tokens with real purpose, use cases, and value are created? Due to the nature of blockchain, there’s nothing that can be done to prevent the creation of these tokens – it’s incredibly easy to deploy a new token contract to Ethereum. The fact that we cannot prevent useless tokens being created means that they need to instead be identified and called out by the community, thereby deterring people from purchasing the token. This is happening more and more as users are becoming educated on what a good token model looks like. However, there’s certainly still work to do. I’m a strong advocate of helping the blockchain community be more diverse. As is true with technology in general, there are a small number of women working in the space. Last year, I ran workshops on Solidity development particularly aimed at women in the hopes that I can motivate them to enter this somewhat intimidating space and to help them do so with the confidence to voice their opinions and ensure they are heard.

Latest Bitcoin price and analysis (BTC to USD)," Last week, when I wrote my usual Monday BTC price analysis, Bitcoin was trading close to $9,200. At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading just below $11,000 after price climbed 16% from $9,200 to $11,070 in just a couple of days. It seems the hypothesis that weekends are good for Bitcoin is indeed true, as BTC consolidated above the key $11,000 level during Saturday and Sunday before a dip going into Monday morning. My gut tells me this is what we’ve all been waiting for. Will Bitcoin maintain its weekend gains during the next few weeks? Has the bull market officially begun? Bitcoin has experienced a major rally that has taken its price upwards close to 34% over the past two weeks. Even with minor retracements, the market is moving positively with higher lows each time it falls, meaning we should expect BTC to continue its climb towards $13,000 – which in my opinion might come within the next couple of weeks. Last week, I mentioned how I was expecting BTC to break and hold above $10,000, which has come to fruition. While I personally am still bullish, others are predicting a sudden correction. Prominent Bitcoin trader davincij15 has claimed all bull markets are expected to suffer large corrections of around 30-35% of the total highs in the early stages. This means we could still see Bitcoin touching its 100-day EMA or even its 200-day EMA despite the bull cycle (which can last a couple of years). We’ve seen similar movements during previous cycles in 2013 and 2016-2017. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal, I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Corrections are expected and welcomed so that we can accumulate even during bull seasons. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past two weeks, volume has gone from $17 billion to $23 billion, consolidating now around $20 billion. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $15,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Of course, if you think I might be overreacting to positive news, you can always check what other expert analysts have to say about this recent price movement. Hopefully, the market will continue this positive momentum. Pay attention to retracements back down towards the 200-day EMA to make new entries. Safe trades!

," Bitcoin slid by 2.75% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 4.1% gain from Monday, Bitcoin ended the day at $9,095.0. A relatively choppy day saw Bitcoin slide from a start of a day intraday high $9,376.8 to a late intraday low $8,945.0. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $9,063.47. Support from the broader market led to a final hour recovery to $9,000 levels. The Tuesday sell-off brought to an end a run of 6 consecutive days in the green. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was another mixed bag for the major cryptos. Binance Coin and Litecoin bucked the trend on the day. While Litecoin eked out a 0.67% gain, Binance Coin rose by 1.45%. The rest of the pack saw red. Leading the way down was Stellar’s Lumen, which slid by 5.48%. EOS (-5.13%), Ripple’s XRP (-4.83%) and Bitcoin Cash ABC (-4.48%) were not far behind on the day. The reversal on the day came in spite of a lack of news events, with the Bitcoin bulls continuing to grab the headlines. News of Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra also did the rounds on the day, but would unlikely have had any material influence. The jury is still out on whether Facebook will be able to successfully launch a cryptocurrency and compete with the likes of Bitcoin. In spite of the Tuesday reversal, the total crypto market cap avoided a pullback to sub-$280bn levels. At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap stood at $283.6bn. Trading volumes eased back, however, falling back from $75bn levels on Sunday to sub-$60bn levels. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.69% to $9,157.5. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from an early morning low $9,062.0 to a high $9,198.0. In spite of the early moves, Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash SV and Litecoin bucked the trend early, with declines of $1.24% and 0.58% respectively. Leading the pack at the time of writing was Bitcoin. Binance Coin was close behind, up by 0.53%. Bitcoin would need to avoid a pullback to sub-$9,140 levels through the day to support a move back through to $9,300 levels. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break through the first major resistance level at $9,332.87. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin could take a run at Sunday’s high $9,490 and $9,500 levels before any pullback. Failure to steer clear of sub-$9,140 levels could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall back through the morning low $9,062.0 would bring sub-$9,000 levels into play. A broad-based crypto sell-off would likely see Bitcoin test the first major support level at $8,901.07 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$8,900 levels on the day. For those looking to see if there’s any correlation between the cryptos and monetary policy, today could be the day. With the FED expected to signal monetary policy easing later in the year will a more dovish FED deliver a boost to the majors?

3," Bitcoin’s mining hash rate has reached an all-time high of 65,000,000 TH/s following positive price action that has seen the asset’s total market cap rise above $200 billion. This level is now firmly above its mid-2018 highs of nearly 60,000,000 TH/s. Following Bitcoin’s parabolic move to the upside over the past few months, the total daily block and transaction reward paid to miners has also seen an almost five-fold increase, rising from under $5 million to currently above $25 million a day. This new all-time high means Bitcoin’s hash rate has completed a dramatic reversal after falling to almost half its current total during the December 2018 capitulation in BTC price. Based on estimates from Litecoin founder Charlie Lee’s September conference talk in San Francisco, the current SHA-256 hash rate translates into around $2 billion in online hardware value for the Bitcoin mining network. Other hourly costs for the network (based on a $0.1 per kwH electricity cost) come to around $605,000 in just electricity alone for those miners to hunt for 75 BTC which would currently trade at around $855,000. With the next Bitcoin halving just 330 days away, between now and then, we may see a new bull market break out for Bitcoin mining before the hourly reward drops down to 37.5 BTC. Mining difficulty is also up around 45% from the December low, while the price of Bitcoin has increased by over 260% in the same period. As ROI for mining operations continues to outpace the returns for BTC, the sideline investor may again look to make a move into the crypto ecosystem to get their hands on one of the 3.2 million BTC that are yet to be issued into circulation.

2," Bitcoin bucked the trend on Sunday, rising by 1.57% to end the day at $10,913.00. 6 days in the green out of 7 saw Bitcoin rally by 21.5%, Monday through Sunday. On the day, a mixed morning saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning high $10,985.00 to a late morning intraday low $10,572.00. Steering well clear of the major support and resistance levels, Bitcoin found support through the afternoon. A late rally saw Bitcoin break through the first major resistance level at $11,290.67 to strike an intraday high and new swing hi $11,369.00. A late pullback left Bitcoin back at sub-$11,000 levels. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red for the major cryptos. Litecoin led the way down on the day, sliding by 3.34%. EOS was close behind, falling by 3.13%. Ethereum saw the most modest losses on the day, falling by 0.49% to hold onto $300 levels. For the week, Litecoin and Stellar’s Lumen saw red, with losses of 0.25% and 0.66% respectively. While Bitcoin led the way with the 21.5% rally, Binance Coin and Ethereum also saw solid gains. The pair ended the week up by 15.4% and by 14.4% respectively. Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash SV also saw double-digit gains on the week. Bitcoin’s trend-bucking move on Sunday led to a further rise in dominance to 59% levels, with a further rise anticipated. Over the course of the week, the total crypto market cap jumped from $285.84bn to $325bn levels on Sunday. 24-hour trading volumes were choppy through the week, however. Volumes fell to $46bn levels on Thursday before recovering to $72bn levels on Sunday. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 1.73% to $10,724.00. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from a morning high $10,922.00 to a low $10,560.00 before finding support. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin came within range of the first major support level at $10,533.67. Elsewhere, it was red across the crypto-board. Leading the way down was Bitcoin Cash SV, with a 3.96% loss. Stellar’s Lumen continued to struggle, falling by 3.03% Ethereum saw more modest losses early on, down by just 0.78% at the time of writing. Bitcoin would need to move through the morning high $10,922.00 to $10,950 levels to support a return to $11,000 levels. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to take a run at the first major resistance level at $11,330.67. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Sunday’s high $11,369 would likely limit any upside on the day. Failure to move through to $10,950 levels could see Bitcoin fall deeper into the red before any recovery. A pullback through the morning low $10,560.00 would likely see Bitcoin fall through the first major support level at $10,533.67. Barring an extended sell-off through the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,400 levels.

What is the relationship between blockchain and artificial intelligence?," It seems that every few years or so, new technologies enter the hype cycle and are touted as the next big game changer.

It seems that every few years or so, new technologies enter the hype cycle and are touted as the next big game changer. Around 10 years ago it was 3D printing. Then, with the creation of Bitcoin, hype emerged regarding the underlying blockchain technology. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) has taken some of that spotlight and has joined the hype train. Blockchain and artificial intelligence could connect the world of the future through the Internet of Things. It is argued that we are currently in the midst of a fourth Industrial Revolution thanks to the advances in technology. Blockchain is just one part of this, and so is artificial intelligence. AI arguably has the potential to remove the necessity for many of the jobs in today’s society. Such arguments have been made by both left-wing and right-wing commentators such as David Graeber and his “bullsh*t jobs” argument. Dr Ben Goertzel, CEO of Singularity, recently spoke to my colleague Jordan Heal, and much of what they discussed regarding AI has many crossovers with blockchain technology, namely decentralisation. Goertzel stated Singularity “should be a decentralised protocol owned by everyone and no-one”. This follows a similar ideology to blockchains. If a blockchain is centralised, then the use case is null and void. Blockchain is sometimes referred to as a slow, inefficient database. While this has an element of truth, there are many projects that are attempting to harness blockchain for economic means such as Bitcoin, and others that store data on the blockchain. Two projects with such aims include Siacoin and Storj. With centralised entities storing their data on a database, there is always the risk of being hacked no matter how high quality your security is. Run a search on Google for data breaches and you’ll see many large companies have been affected with personal data being leaked. By storing this data on a blockchain, it should be theoretically possible to discourage attackers as blockchains prove much harder to hack provided they have enough hashing power. Under a decentralised storage system, AI could then analyse the data, thereby improving its own knowledge for the benefit of us. Currently, having so much data stored on a database benefits companies such as Facebook who can then use that data to build a picture of its users to target them with advertising. Both blockchain and artificial intelligence can have anarchist underpinnings of decentralisation, returning power to the community instead of a centralised corporation. Should AI truly take hold as Dr Ben Goertzel argues, then with many jobs becoming obsolete, it may necessitate a new economic paradigm and a change of mentality from both the state and its citizens. Whether Bitcoin or blockchain technology can be helpful in this regard is still being debated today. Commentator and podcaster Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano has recently argued that Bitcoin could help solve the inequality that is currently prevalent in the United States. Were Graeber’s and Goertzel’s ideas to come to fruition, with the job market losing so many jobs, this income equality could be heightened. Pomp argues that Bitcoin can solve this issue. New technologies bring with them a lot of hype and promise, but it is possible for them to change the way human society functions. The computer changed the way we work and led to the creation of the internet, which allowed us all to become more connected, for good and for bad. Mobile phones have only added to this sense of connectedness. It is clear that new technologies can be revolutionary. Despite both blockchain and AI being talked about as possible game changers, it is too early to guarantee this. Until we can verify their use case through real-world applications, we cannot trust those that are promising us the world. With that being said, both blockchain and AI seem to be entering an almost symbiotic partnership of decentralisation, attempting to revolutionise the way that we as citizens will interact with our governments, each other, and the world.

1," Iranian cryptocurrency miners are taking advantage of subsidized energy in the country, and it is putting pressure on its power grids, Bloomberg News reports.  As per Iranian state media, a spokesperson for Tadvin Electricity Company faulted cryptocurrency miners for a 7% increase in energy consumption in the country.  “The production of each Bitcoin uses the equivalent of the annual consumption of 24 properties in Tehran, or one property’s consumption of electricity for 24 years,” Mostafa Rajabi Mashhad said. As such, Iran's Power Ministry could implement a tariff on miners, according to Bloomberg. Cryptocurrency use has increased generally in the country as a way to circumvent sanctions put on the country by the US government. ",Frank Chaparro,The Block,2019-06-29T17:18:10.000Z
"Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 01/07/19"," Bitcoin Cash ABC tumbled by 10.4% on Sunday. Reversing a 2.19% gain from Saturday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the week down 15.7% at $396.33. The sell-off left Bitcoin Cash ABC down by 10.5% for the month of June. A choppy morning saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise to an early intraday high $446.9 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $449.99, Bitcoin Cash ABC slid to a late afternoon low $396.36 before finding support. The reversal saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall through the first major support level at $421.59 and second major support level at $402.91. Of greater significance was the fall through the 23.6% FIB of $418. A late recovery to $416 levels was short-lived. Bitcoin Cash ABC slid back through the second major support level to an intraday low $396.33. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 3.41% to $409.85. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rises from a morning low $396.0 to a high $410.11 before easing back. Bitcoin Cash ABC left the major support and resistance levels untested early on, while also falling short of the 23.6% FIB of $418. For the day ahead, a move through the 23.6% FIB would bring the first major resistance level at $430.04 into play. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from $418 levels. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin Cash ABC hit reverse later in the day. A fall through the morning low $396 would bring the first major support level at $379.47 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$370 support levels on the day. Litecoin fell by 8.4% on Sunday. Partially reversing an 11.58% rally from Saturday, Litecoin ended the week down 10.7% at $122.06. The reversal left Litecoin with just a 6.7% gain for the month of June. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin recover from a morning low $126.0 to strike a late morning intraday high $136.81. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $141.47, Litecoin tumbled to a late intraday low $119.03. Finding support at the first major support level at $119.97, Litecoin recovered to $122 levels at the day end. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 1.61% to $124.02. Tracking the broader market, Litecoin rose from a morning low $120.52 to a high $125.56 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a move through the morning high to $126 levels would support a run at $130 levels on the day. In the event of an extended rally through the day, Litecoin would likely test the first major resistance level at $132.81. Failure to move back through the morning high could see Litecoin hit reverse. A fall through the morning low $120.52 could see Litecoin test support at the 23.6% FIB of $117. Barring a crypto meltdown, the first major support level at $115.3 should limit any downside in the event of a reversal. Ripple’s XRP fell by 7.4% on Sunday. Reversing a 0.64% gain from Saturday, Ripple’s XRP ended the week down 16.2% at $0.3943. Ripple’s XRP ended the month of June down 9.9%.

Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Ripple’s XRP fell through the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164 and first major support level at $0.4083. It was the first time since 13th June that Ripple’s XRP ended the day at sub-$0.40 levels… At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 4.64% to $0.41260. A particularly bullish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rise from a morning low $0.39013 to a high $0.4160. While falling short of the first major resistance level at $0.4177, the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164 pinned Ripple’s XRP back early on. For the day ahead, a break through the 23.6% FIB would support a rebound on the day. Barring an extended crypto rally, however, the first major resistance level at $0.4177 would likely leave $0.42 levels out of reach. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse. A fall through to $0.4050 levels would bring sub-$0.40 levels back into play.

1," A Facebook scam has been targeting United Arab Emirates residents, The National writes. Scammers used the image of Abu Dhabi’s Crown Prince, claiming he endorses the Bitcoin projects and is helping people make profits. According to the report, the scam was disseminated on Facebook via a sponsored post, which has been shared thousands of times and has generated even more comments. However, at the moment, it is not certain how many people were tricked into sending their money. Fraudsters promised that the scheme, which cost AED 1,000 (approximately $270), would make people “rich in seven days.” The sponsored post included a fake quote from the Crown Prince, claiming the scheme was his “way of giving back to the people.” The post linked to a fake news story that mixed facts with fabrications; it included a fake quote from Bill Gates and as well as a fictitious tweet from Sheikh Mohamed. The story itself was penned by a nonexistent journalist Michael Alvarado, and used a picture of a U.S.-based freelance journalist Timothy Seppala, who had been unaware his picture was used for a scam. Since the scam has been unearthed, the Facebook page used for the scam has been deleted.  The Abu Dhabi Media Office has urged people to “check the authenticity of campaigns asking for pledges or donations in case of fraud, particularly online and on social media.”",Carol Gaszcz,The Block,2019-07-01T19:51:26.000Z

Also seeing heavy losses were Litecoin (-3.26%), Tron (-2.89%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (-2.59%), and EOS (-2.37%). Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash SV saw more modest losses of 0.84% and 0.48% respectively. For Stellar’s Lumen, things haven’t improved since falling out of the top ten with a 2.16% loss on the day. With Bitcoin bucking the trend to see green on the day, Bitcoin’s dominance moved back to 61% levels. The total crypto market cap recovered from sub-$290 levels on Tuesday to end the day at $313.2bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 2.73% to $11,182 as the bulls look to restore order. Moves within the first hour saw Bitcoin rise from a low $10,876 to a high $11,200 before easing back. While leaving the major support and resistance levels untested early on, Bitcoin came within range of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day for the majors. Ethereum tracked Bitcoin early on, with a 1.01% gain. Tron (+0.94%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.03%), and Litecoin (+1.18%) also made solid gains. Bucking the trend in the early hours, however, was Binance Coin with a 0.31% loss. Bitcoin would need to move through the 23.6% FIB of $11,257 to bring the first major resistance level at $11,323.93 into play. Having failed to touch $11,000 levels on Tuesday, the early move should support a bullish day ahead. An early break through the first major resistance level would bring $11,500 levels into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at the second major resistance level at $11,762.87. Failure to move through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall back through to $10,500 levels would bring the first major support level at $10,087.13 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$10,000 support levels on the day.

Non-custodial crypto wallet ZenGo adding support for Facebook’s Libra coin," ZenGo, a provider of non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet, is adding support for Facebook's upcoming cryptocurrency Libra, according to an announcement Tuesday. The firm has released a proof-of-concept for Libra testnet, using a cryptographic technique called threshold signatures scheme (TSS), which helps create a secure and easy-to-use transaction process. ""TSS removes the burden of the single atomic private key and splits the responsibility between multiple parties. Each of the parties generates its own secret and uses this secret to distributively sign a transaction without revealing the secret to the other parties,"" ZenGo explained. Facebook's crypto subsidiary, Calibra, will be launching a default custodial wallet for storing Libra, but that could hinder mass adoption of the cryptocurrency because users would have to trust Calibra to store their coins, ZenGo CEO, Ouriel Ohayon, told The Block. ""True ownership comes with non-custodial options which Libra seems to encourage too. The challenge is to get a large number of users unfamiliar with security, key management and complex backup process to cross that path. It's great to see that developers can build true non-custodial Calibra alternatives where users control their funds,"" Ohayon added. ZenGo wallet currently supports bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) cryptocurrencies. It is currently also preparing to add support for Binance's BNB, Zilliqa's ZIL and Tezos' XTZ tokens, with more cryptocurrencies planned for the future, per the announcement. ZenGo recently raised $4 million from investors including Samsung and Benson Oak Ventures, aiming to simplify the process of storing and managing cryptocurrencies for common men.",Yogita Khatri,The Block,2019-07-02T13:42:43.000Z
The Crypto Daily – The Movers and Shakers 01/07/19," The Bears fought back at the end of the month. Bitcoin slid by 9.33% on Sunday. Following on from a 3.38% loss on Saturday, Bitcoin ended the week down 0.92% at $10,809. The Sunday reversal left Bitcoin up 26.7% for the month of June. Range-bound through the early hours, Bitcoin struck an early intraday high $12,234 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $12,390.33, Bitcoin slid to a late afternoon low $10,889. The sell-off saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level at $11,397.33 and 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Coming within range of the second major support level at $10,874.67, Bitcoin recovered to $11,400 levels before sliding back. The late pullback saw Bitcoin fall through the first major support level, 23.6% FIB, and second major support level at $10,874.67 to an intraday low $10,668. The Sunday sell-off saw Bitcoin’s market cap fall back to sub-$200bn levels after having hit a June high $245.13bn on Thursday. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a sea of red across the crypto-board. Bitcoin Cash ABC led the way down on the day, sliding by 10.4%. The rest of the majors were close behind, however. Binance Coin fell by 9.9%, with Bitcoin Cash SV falling by 9.1%. Things were not much better for Stellar’s Lumen (-8.87%), EOS (-8.85%), Litecoin (-8.4%) and Ethereum (-8.31%). The best performer on the day was Ripple’s XRP, which fell by just 7.43%. For the week, EOS led the way down, sliding by 20.76%. Bitcoin Cash SV (-18.39%), Ripple’s XRP (-16.19%), Binance Coin (-13.81%) and Litecoin (-10.68%) all saw heavy losses. Bucking the trend was Stellar’s Lumen that gained 7.19%.

Joining Stellar’s Lumen in the red for June were EOS (-32.42%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (-10.5%), Ripple’s XRP (-9.88%) and Binance Coin (-2.86%). Bucking the trend in June, alongside Bitcoin, were Ethereum (+8.6%) and Litecoin (+6.65%). The moves through Sunday saw Bitcoin’s dominance fall back to 61% levels. Sunday’s reversal left the total crypto market cap at $324.83bn, down from Thursday’s high $386.7bn. In spite of the $60bn drop, the market cap remained well above $273bn levels seen at the start of the month. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 1.49% to $10,970. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise from a morning low $10,641 to a high $11,123 before easing back. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on, while also falling short of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. Elsewhere, it was green across the crypto-board, with Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash SV leading the way. The pair were up by 3.07% and by 2.83% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move back through the morning high $11,123 to break through the 23.6% FIB to restore confidence. A move through the 23.6% FIB would bring the first major resistance level at $11,806 into play. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to take a run at $12,000 levels. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB could see Bitcoin hit reverse. A fall through the morning low $10,641 would bring the first major support level at $10,240 into play.

4," Despite the recent bitcoin price spike, big traders are bearish, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The outlet reported data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showing managers holding 14% more short positions in CME bitcoin futures last week than long positions. Other firms, neither money managers nor small investors, also held three times as many short positions, according to the report. Futures allow traders to bet on the rise and fall of an asset, so the increase of short positions indicates an overall bearish attitude by big players. However, bitcoin has risen above $11,000, indicating there is some optimism. The CFTC report showed small investors held more long positions. The demographic of investors with fewer than 25 BTC contracts showed four times as many long positions. That report was released Friday, with data reflecting when bitcoin was hovering around $9,000. ",Aislinn Keely,The Block,2019-06-25T23:11:32.000Z

," Bitcoin Cash ABC fell by 2.59% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 4.11% gain from Monday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $408.02. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall from an early intraday high $418.87 to a late morning intraday low $383.16. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin Cash ABC fell through the 23.6% FIB of $418 and the first major support level at $394.38. Finding support through the afternoon, Bitcoin Cash ABC recovered to $400 levels to limit the loss on the day. In spite of the partial recovery, Bitcoin Cash ABC was unable to move back through the 23.6% FIB… At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 1.1% to $412.50. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $408.41 to a high $418.0. Whilst falling short of the first major resistance level at $423.54, the 23.6% FIB of $418 continued to limit progress. For the day ahead, Bitcoin Cash ABC would need to steer clear of sub-$410 levels to support another run at the first major resistance level at $423.54. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the 23.6% FIB of $418. An extended crypto rally through the day could see Bitcoin Cash ABC test the second major resistance level at $439.06. Failure to avoid sub-$410 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC slide back through to sub-$400 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, the first major support level at $387.87 should limit any downside on the day. Litecoin slid by 3.26% on Tuesday. Reversing a 0.42% gain from Monday with interest, Litecoin ended the day at $118.59. A particularly bearish morning saw Litecoin slide from an intraday high $123.41 to a mid-morning intraday low $111.2. The reversal saw Litecoin slide through the 23.6% FIB of $117 and the first major support level at $114.94. Finding support through the afternoon, Litecoin managed a brief return to $120 levels before easing back. The 23.6% FIB proved to be the resistance line on the day. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 1.63% to $120.52. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a morning low $118.54 to a high $123.16 before easing back. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested and also held above the 23.6% FIB of $117. For the day ahead, a hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 through the morning would support a bullish day ahead. A move back through the morning high $123.16 would bring the first major resistance level at $124.27 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Litecoin would likely see any upside capped at $126 levels on the day. Failure to hold above the 23.6% FIB of $117 could see Litecoin test the first major support level at $112.06 before any recovery. Barring a crypto sell-off later in the day, Litecoin should steer clear of sub-$110 support levels on the day. Ripple’s XRP fell by 1.98% on Tuesday. Partially reversing a 3.4% gain from Monday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.39991. Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP fell from an early intraday high $0.41187 to a late morning intraday low $0.38414. Falling well short of the major resistance levels, Ripple’s XRP fell through the first major support level at $0.3922. Recovery through the afternoon saw Ripple’s XRP return to $0.4040 levels before sliding back to sub-$0.40 levels. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was up by 0.74% to $0.40288. Tracking the broader market, Ripple’s XRP rose from a morning low $0.39989 to a high $0.40711 before easing back. Ripple’s XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on and also fell short of the 23.6% FIB of $0.4164. For the day ahead, a hold onto $0.40 levels through the morning would support further gains later in the day. A move back through the morning high $0.40711 would bring the first major resistance level at $0.4131 into play. Ripple’s XRP would need the support of the broader market, however, to break through the 23.6 % FIB of $0.4164. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Ripple’s XRP would likely come up short of $0.42 levels on the day. Failure to move back through the morning high $0.40711 could see Ripple’s XRP hit reverse. A fall through to sub-$0.40 levels would bring the first major support level at $0.3854 into play before any recovery.

5," Square’s Cash App is launching bitcoin deposits, CoinDesk writes. The app might have started rolling out the feature prior to full launch as deposits are not yet available for all Cash App users. Cash App users can purchase and sell bitcoin; they can also make cryptocurrency transfers to other wallets. According to Cash App’s website, the company will enable deposits to third-party wallets “soon.” “In the meantime, you can transfer profits from selling bitcoin to any bank account or debit card linked to your Cash App,” it reads. Square has been putting a lot of money into bitcoin, which has generated $65.5 million in revenue in just the first quarter of 2019.

Cryptocurrency market update: Altcoins on the rise?," At the time of writing, the positive momentum in the cryptocurrency markets is still present. Bitcoin is well on the way to $20,000, and that means we can expect some altcoins to pump higher as well. Bitcoin broke through the $9,000, $10,000, and $11,000 levels with ease last month, but has struggled to consistently remain above $12,000. After hovering close to $14,000, it broke down toward its 20-day EMA, touching the $9,600 level again. We can’t forget that Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset that is helping investors dodge economic and geopolitical risks in the form of trade wars, sluggish GDP growth, and what appears to be a new era of quantitative easing for central banks. For that reason, the coin has emerged as the top-performing asset of 2019, vastly outperforming stocks, bonds, commodities, and government-backed currencies. Plus, Bitcoin’s all-time ROI is now over 6,000%. Another positive price indicator is the fact that gold-bugs and more traditional asset-based investors seem to be turning to Bitcoin as a safe haven from a possible economic meltdown coming at the end of the year or in 2020. The correlation between bitcoin and gold is now the highest its been since 2016. pic.twitter.com/jgO6D2xalE — Mati Greenspan (@MatiGreenspan) July 3, 2019    Let’s take a look at how the top cryptocurrencies have been performing. Bitcoin is evolving as expected. Its overall value keeps increasing, and if you look at the volumes profile on the left of the graph above, you’ll notice there’s plenty of volume keeping BTC above the critical $11,000 level. My prediction that Bitcoin could hit $20,000 by the end of the year could turn into an “end of the month” kind of deal. Assuming the positive trend continues and BTC price continues to rise, we should expect higher volumes coming in at key levels close to $20,000. Although many retail investors will be looking to sell some of their gains when Bitcoin hits all-time highs again, we can expect the price to keep going at least for a few weeks. However, as the market becomes more liquid, we should expect fewer violent swings, so it could take longer for BTC to reach a new high. Let’s not forget that I consider Bitcoin to be in a bull run when the 20-day EMA is above the 50-day EMA and the latter is above the 200-day EMA. As we’ve already accomplished that goal – not only in shorter time frames but also in daily and weekly ones as well – I personally think the bears have retreated and bulls are now firmly in charge. Volume also seems to be increasing as well. Over the past two weeks, volume has gone from $17 billion to $23 billion, consolidating now around $20 billion. Putting all this information together, we’re now clearly on the right path to reach $15,000 – or maybe even $20,000 – by the end of 2019. Looking at the Ethereum chart above, we can clearly see a couple of interesting features. Firstly, the 20-day EMA has crossed the 50-day EMA, and the latter has crossed the 200-day EMA, which are both quite bullish signals. Price is now also trading well above the 200-day EMA at over $300. Moreover, there could now be new support forming around $305, just above the 200-day EMA. This means the likelihood that price will come crashing down past this level is now lower, and will continue to diminish as long as ETH can hold this key level. For the time being, I expect ETH to maintain its positive momentum, as I don’t see a reason for the positive trend to break. Volume-wise, ETH has been growing steadily and is now close to the $8 billion region. Recent news from the Ethereum Foundation is putting positive pressure on price, as the coin is expected to have at least a testnet of the new Casper PoS models ready by the first half of 2020. With the upcoming Libra project – a currency envisioned by the Facebook team – there will be extra pressure on Ethereum to develop as both have similar goals in terms of smart contract functionality. Ripple (XRP) was experiencing a pretty bullish period until the beginning of July, when price came crashing down below all its EMAs. At the time of writing, XRP is trading close to $0.40 after falling about 20% from its 2019 high north of $0.50. During June, XRP managed to cross the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day EMAs as volumes went berserk. I expected support to be around $0.43 and then again at $0.38, where the 200-day EMA is sitting. The $0.43 level of support fell pretty easily, but it seems like $0.38 is holding for now. I’m not entirely sure how price will move from here, but as long as Bitcoin maintains a positive slope, I expect Ripple to regain some of its latest losses. LTC has been consolidating nicely around its 20-day EMA, which is quite an amazing achievement from a coin that was trading at around $30 in January 2019 and peaked at $147 in June. Fundamentals remain strong as LTC’s adoption keeps rising due to small fees and faster block times. Plus, the halvening event is just around the corner, and this usually has a tendency to push price upwards. At the moment, price is trading above $115, and I expect it to continue to rise toward the $130 and $150 levels, where it should find the usual resistance. That is of course assuming Bitcoin maintains its positive trend. If you were one of the smart ones who bought in during the early 2019 dip, congratulations! LTC has been one of the best performing coins in 2019. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently sitting above $407 – almost 20% lower than last month. Bitcoin is still gaining market-share dominance over most coins, including BCH, and BCH price is currently trading at its lowest against BTC since late 2018. However, this doesn’t mean investors won’t take this opportunity to convert BTC into BCH. Bitcoin Cash has broken the major $350 level around its 20-day EMA, and the 50-day EMA has finally crossed the 200-day EMA. Moreover, the trend seems to be quite bullish, even though volumes have shrunk over the past week – like most altcoins. If order books stay on the side of buyers, which will become increasingly difficult the more price goes up, we could see BCH climbing again to $500 and above in just a few weeks. I expect Bitcoin to continue moving in an upwards trajectory with the usual 20-30% dips before we break all-time highs later this year. The major altcoins will follow Bitcoin’s lead as people begin to spread their gains and diversify their portfolios. Will this happen? Or will the market cool off during the summer?

Why the Fed should oversee Facebook’s Libra," Facebook (FB) Mark Zuckerberg’s recent announcement of ambitious plans to launch a new, global cryptocurrency called Libra has been met with understandable alarm, particularly among regulators and consumer advocates. Much of the controversy has centered around antitrust issues, consumer privacy, and the ability of crooks to anonymously use the system for illicit purposes. Those are all legitimate concerns, but to my mind, the biggest risks are financial, both to users of Libra and the financial system as a whole. Those risks include the possibility of bank runs, credit disruptions, or consumer losses arising from foreign currency risks or financial mismanagement of the Libra reserve. The best way to understand these risks is to follow the money. Let’s start with the process of buying and redeeming Libra. Most cryptocurrencies, including the granddaddy of them all, Bitcoin, have failed to gain widespread acceptance as a method of payment because of their volatility. Zuckerberg hopes to avoid this problem by backing Libra with a reserve of stable world currencies, including the dollar, Euro, and Swiss franc. So you can buy Libra with pretty much any fiat currency — a U.S. dollar, Brazilian Real, Mongolian Tugrik, Indian Rupee — but the amount of Libra you receive will depend on the exchange rate between your currency and the basket of currencies in the reserve at the time of purchase. When you want to redeem your Libra back into your fiat currency, you may get more. But you may also get a lot less, particularly in developing countries with unstable currencies. It will depend on the exchange rate at the time of redemption. Let’s say you still want to buy this hip new digital coin, regardless of the foreign exchange risk. Where do you get the money? For citizens in the U.S. and other developed countries, the money will probably come from your bank account. It’s not going to hurt the banking system if you withdraw a few hundred a month for Libra transactions. But what if everyone decides they want to replace their bank accounts with Libra? After all, this would be a great way to avoid checking account fees. Retailers will love Libra as a way to avoid paying network fees on debit and credit card transactions. All of a sudden, that giant sucking sound is money coming out of the banks and into Libra’s kitty. You may think, “Fine. Let’s stick it to the banks. Look what they did to the economy in 2008.” But most of that money you withdraw from the banks is money they will no longer have to lend to the economy. So as Libra captures your cash, banks have less to make loans. With a run on the banks, we also get a credit contraction. Now Libra has your money (not the banks) and you have your digital coins. What will Libra do with your money? Libra’s white paper says your digital coin is safe because it will be backed by a basket of the most stable world currencies. But it’s not as if Libra will be purchasing paper money in each of these currencies and piling them in a bank vault. What this really means is that Libra will be taking your money and investing it in instruments denominated in those currencies. The return on these investments is how Facebook and other Libra founders will make money. Thus they will have incentives to invest in instruments that will maximize those returns, which may or may not maintain the stable value Libra’s founders are promising. The white paper promises to invest in low volatility assets such as bank deposits and short-term government securities, using “investment grade” financial institutions as custodians. (Reminder: Lehman Bros had an “A” rating from Standard and Poor’s before its collapse in 2008.) But there is no regulatory body to ensure that it does so, nor to require that Libra’s sponsors put up any of their own capital or reserves to backstop those investments if they go sour. In essence, Libra proposes the failed business model used by money market funds prior to the financial crisis. It wants you to buy Libra on the promise that the coin will maintain stable value, but there will be no regulatory oversight of what Libra actually does with your money and no capital and liquidity requirements that you would typically find with a bank. That structure proved disastrous during the 2008 crisis, when the Reserve Fund, a money market fund that heavily invested in Lehman Bros debt, “broke the buck” and prompted widespread runs on other money market funds. Even if Libra keeps its promise to put your money only in relatively safe bank deposits and government securities, we still have a problem. If the money comes out of banks (where it supports private sector lending) and goes into government securities, we would see a massive re-allocation of resources from the private to the public sectors. If you believe (as do I) that the market is generally a better allocator of economic resources than the government, this re-allocation will serve as a drag on economic growth. Libra says it will also put your money into bank deposits. Bank accounts have the advantage of maintaining stable value. Your bank account balance doesn’t fluctuate as would a securities investment. And perhaps this helps with our bank run problem. You take money out of your bank to buy Libra. Libra puts yours and other users’ money into other banks, which will presumably use it to make loans. But banks do fail, and depositors take losses on their uninsured deposits. So while Libra is saying it’s offering a better alternative to banks because it won’t be taking risk by lending out your money the way banks do, it will be putting at least some of your money right back into banks of its choosing. When you withdrew money from your bank to buy Libra, you probably had less than $250,000 in your account, meaning it was fully protected by the FDIC. But Libra’s founders hope to have a global reserve of hundreds of billions of dollars. Even if they spread the funds among multiple banks, at those levels, the lion’s share will likely be uninsured. Anyone who has followed my writings on blockchain knows that I’m enthusiastic about the use of distributed ledger technology to remove frictions in the payments system. So I don’t mean to sound too negative. The problem is, so long as cryptocurrencies have to rely on fiat currencies to maintain stable value, they will be exposed to the same kinds of risks embedded in the banking systems that support those currencies. I believe most of these risks can be addressed with thoughtful regulation. But before Mark Zuckenberg or anyone else tries to create his own global currency, we need to settle on an adequate regulatory framework to govern them. It would make sense for Congress to give the Federal Reserve Board lead authority for overseeing Libra, given its responsibility to conduct monetary policy and oversee an effective and efficient payments system. It is also an experienced financial supervisor, well-equipped to develop capital and liquidity requirements for Libra and other such ventures. In exercising that authority, the Fed could build on the pioneering work of the New York Department of Financial Services which currently regulates two trust companies which have successfully launched stable coins backed by the U.S. dollar. (Disclosure. I serve on the board of one of those trusts, Paxos.) Technology has the potential to dramatically change how the world pays for things in the future. Whether that transition is beneficial to consumers and businesses or financially disruptive will depend on whether regulators can stay ahead of this potentially rapid transformation. It’s open to question whether Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are the right stewards for a new global cryptocurrency. But by firing this warning shot to government policy makers that such a change is coming and potentially coming soon, they have done a public service.

2," Following Bitcoin’s momentary breach of $9,000 last week, the market quickly reversed and price fell almost $1,000 to a low of just over $8,000. Since then, the market found support above $8,400 to trade up to a weekend high of $8,800. Since that local high, Bitcoin again started to sell off over the last 12 hours to retest and find support again around the $8,400 level. This level is historically key as the 2017 support found here helped propel Bitcoin’s parabolic rise up to an eventual high of $20,000. If price can find support following this morning’s fall, then it looks like it may be consolidating inside a potential rising wedge formation. At the time of writing, it looks like we may see some more short-term consolidation inside this formation. Any break outside the upper or lower bounds would most likely cause Bitcoin to either fall back down to around the $6,800 support level or – if we see a bull market continuation – rise back up to a five-figure valuation for the world’s most decentralised digital asset.

On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are. The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without “relying on trust”. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number “0” (or the “genesis block”), which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins.

Brave browser set to enable BAT tipping on internet giant Reddit," Users of Reddit, one of the top 20 internet sites in the world, will soon be able to tip one another using the Basic Attention Token (BAT) cryptocurrency, according to a report in Decrypt. The tipping functionality will only be available to users of the Brave browser. The Brave browser allows users to be compensated with the BAT token in return for viewing ""privacy-respecting ads"" in a scheme called Brave Rewards. Users can then opt to contribute to content creators who they frequent using these Brave Rewards. Reddit is one of the largest cryptocurrency information and community gateways in the world. The Bitcoin subreddit has more than 1.1 million members and the CryptoCurrency subreddit has nearly 900K members. The introduction of a cryptocurrency tip button on a site with 1.6 billion monthly visits and an audience that is crypto-friendly will be the largest mainstream test to date for BAT as a means of payment. Update: The post has been updated to reflect that the tipping functionality will be enabled for users of the Brave browser rather than on Reddit proper, contrary to the original Decrypt report.",The Block,None,2019-07-01T02:37:16.000Z

Crypto to Venezuela's rescue? A non-profit uses digital coin to ease crisis," A charity founded by Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong is donating cryptocurrency to citizens in Venezuela, with the country roiled by famine, disease and political turmoil. As Venezuela’s political and economic crisis reaches a boiling point, GiveCrypto.org has figured a workaround to a widespread shortage of money. The organization is donating cryptocurrency to Venezuelans in need, to buy groceries and household goods. “We early on selected Venezuela as where we are going to work, primarily because money is so broken there,” said Joe Waltman, executive director of GiveCrypto.org told YFi PM in an interview. The lack of food and money has worsened a crisis that’s driven nearly 4 million of its citizens from the oil-rich Andean nation, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Those who can’t leave the country are at extreme risk of starvation, as surging prices erode the value of Venezuela’s currency. Venezuela’s collapsing economy has been hit by skyrocketing hyperinflation, power cuts and shortages of food and medicine. It’s prompted some to look to the crypto market for solutions. Over the last year, the Venezuelan government has created its own digital currency, called the petro, to help ease the crisis. And at least one other charity, called Airdrop Venezuela, is collecting cryptocurrency donations to distribute to 100,000 Venezuelans. Meanwhile, GiveCrypto.org works by recruiting on the ground “ambassadors” who will identify persons in need. Each participant will receive $10 paid in Ethereum (ETH) per week for six weeks. The organization will employ a field contractor to help recruit local vendors that accepts cryptocurrency payments and sell primary items like food and household supplies. “We have people on the ground who are trusted, who understands the situation in their communities,” Waltman told Yahoo Finance. “We rely on them to select people that are in need, and we directly transfer cryptocurrency to the people who are ambassador-select,” he added. The cryptocurrency payment and transaction is managed through Coinbase’s “Wallet Lite” app that is enhanced with Spanish-language options, and compatible with Android 4.1 and above. GiveCrypto.org said recently that this will help reach 96% of Android users in Venezuela.  Volatile price swings in the crypto market might make GiveCrypto’s solution seem curious. However, with an annual inflation rate at over 1,000,000%, digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are relatively more stable than the Venezuelan bolivar. “On the vendor side, it’s not that hard of a pitch,” Waltman explained to Yahoo Finance. “If you go to a local corner store and say, ‘Hey, we’re going to be distributing cryptocurrency...to x people within 500 meter radius from your store, do you want to be the only place they can spend this?’” he asked. “Most small business owners will jump at that chance.” Some of the biggest donors so far are well known figures in the cryptocurrency world—including Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse— and former “Mighty Ducks” actor Brock Pierce, who is director of the Bitcoin Foundation. “We expect the crypto community is probably the place to where we will be getting a good chunk of the donations,” Waltman said. “Our mission is in line with some of the early crypto people.”  Grete Suarez is producer at Yahoo Finance for YFi PM and The Ticker.

Thomas Lee thinks the crypto community is a lot smaller than people think," Speaking on stage at the London CryptoCompare conference last week, Thomas Lee claimed that the size of the global crypto community may be only half a million people. Lee believes that “crypto is a lot smaller” than most people think. He said that although most people seem to agree that crypto is a “1.9 million user market”, he thinks that there are closer to “500,000 people in the world that own crypto”. Bullish $crypto twitter is way better than during the bear market. — Emptybeerbottle (@Fullbeerbottle) June 16, 2019  The Fundstrat Global analyst said that “one way to measure this is to look at crypto Twitter”.  He said that a “huge number of followers on crypto Twitter is generally around 100,000”, and that only a few people have close to 1 million followers on their account. Lee himself has only 70,000 followers. Comparing this to a mainstream community like global soccer, even the 500 most popular players have close to 1 million social media followers. He said that this could potentially be really bullish because if “Bitcoin is at over $8,000 with only 500,000 followers, imagine what Bitcoin’s price is going to be when you have four and a half million” people interested in the technology. The co-founder of Fundstrat Global reiterated over the weekend that “crypto winter is over”, adding that with Bitcoin back at new 2019 highs, “don’t those old highs [$20,000] look like a few FOMO days away?” In his talk, the regular CNBC guest told the audience: “If Bitcoin trades above $10,000, then chances are that we will see $40,000 in the next five months.” @fundstrat: “If #Bitcoin trades above $10,000 then chances are that we will see $40,000 in the next five month”@CryptoCompare pic.twitter.com/fWh1SMiyg1 — Nawaz Sulemanji (@coinrivetnawaz) June 12, 2019  Speaking exclusively to Coin Rivet after his talk, Lee told us: “$10,000 could happen soon, because if you take the 10 best days for Bitcoin in any given year, two good days in Bitcoin can take you right back to $10,000.” Although he couldn’t see any catalyst on the horizon in the short term, he did say that anyone who thinks Bitcoin can’t return to its old highs is “kind of sceptical, because they’re ignoring history”. With the wealth transfer between baby boomers and millennials now in full swing, Lee again reiterated on stage that the next bull run in crypto could likely take Bitcoin to well over $100,000 – as more and more young people make the choice to allocate capital towards digital assets instead of traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds that were favoured by their parents’ generation.

1," At the recent CryptoCompare conference in London, Coin Rivet had the chance to catch up with Kraken business development manager Austin Alexander, who shared his thoughts on the entry of institutional money into the decentralised asset economy. Austin started out by telling us that institutional money will come eventually because Bitcoin will continue to grow as it’s “the best money that’s ever been created”. He said: “If they want to come now or they want to come next year or they want to wait 10 years, the sooner the better for these institutions. But there’s infinite fiat out there. There’s infinite slave money, so that’s great.” The Bitcoin OG and co-founder of the New York Bitcoin Centre reminded us that “there’s only 21 million Bitcoin” and that this is the metric that exchanges should be planning their business models around. He added: “The supply side is what is most important to go after because Bitcoin is amazing – the bad money will chase the good money.” The Kraken exec – whose exchange regularly sees volume of over $200 million a day – told us: “If you have coins on your marketplace, if you have that liquidity, you have that supply. “All these exchanges that have focused on institutional investors or being the top regulated marketplace, they’re all the least liquid exchanges out there.” However, the four-year company veteran told us that some unnamed established exchanges may be an exception to this rule, but only because of “the near monopoly they had on retail banking – at least back then”. He exclaimed that if an exchange is now exclusively targeting an institutional investor base, it is a “losing strategy from the start”. Building on and with Bitcoin seems to be the way to go according to Alexander. It was recently revealed that Kraken was sending Bitcoin salary payments to over 250 employees across the world. On this topic, Austin said: “We have a lot of people who are somewhat remote digital nomads. If you’re travelling or living in places outside of the kind of banked West, it’s better to have Bitcoin as it works better than the US dollar.” We respect the quest for sound money but @PeterSchiff is wrong when he says ""there is no way that people are going to work for salaries paid in bitcoin"". Kraken paid 250 salaries in bitcoin in April and more employees are opting for crypto every month. https://t.co/OZuh4gcbfw — Kraken Exchange (@krakenfx) May 23, 2019  Austin passionately concluded that “Bitcoin is what’s important if you build on it”. “The focus should be on the supply side, on catering to the coins – the institutions don’t have coins. They have fiat, which is garbage money. It is slave money. It is infinite money. “If you build for that audience, they’re coming, whether they realise it or not. Whether they like it or not, they will follow the coins, not the other way around.” For more news, guides, and cryptocurrency analysis, click here.

Cash App is adding support for bitcoin deposits," Square’s Cash App is launching bitcoin deposits, CoinDesk writes. The app might have started rolling out the feature prior to full launch as deposits are not yet available for all Cash App users. Cash App users can purchase and sell bitcoin; they can also make cryptocurrency transfers to other wallets. According to Cash App’s website, the company will enable deposits to third-party wallets “soon.” “In the meantime, you can transfer profits from selling bitcoin to any bank account or debit card linked to your Cash App,” it reads. Square has been putting a lot of money into bitcoin, which has generated $65.5 million in revenue in just the first quarter of 2019. CEO Jack Dorsey has voiced his support for bitcoin, saying it is the best candidate to become a global currency for the internet.",Carol Gaszcz,The Block,2019-06-26T14:55:39.000Z
"Facebook's cryptocurrency project is called Calibra, will launch in 2020"," Facebook (FB) on Tuesday announced the details of its widely-rumored cryptocurrency project: a financial services offering called Calibra. Calibra is a “newly formed Facebook subsidiary” and its first product, launching in 2020, will be a digital wallet to store and send Libra, a new cryptocurrency. The digital wallet will initially be available inside WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and eventually as a standalone app for iOS and Android. Calibra will enable users to send Libra to each other “as easily and instantly as you might send a text message, and at low to no cost.” Eventually, Facebook says, “we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, such as paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code, or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass.” Libra, the cryptocurrency, will run on its own Libra blockchain, which today launches an open-source testnet. The blockchain and cryptocurrency will all be overseen by the Libra Association, a not-for-profit that is separate from Facebook and headquartered in Geneva. The Libra Association posted its announcement at the same time as Facebook’s Calibra announcement, and says it is targeting the first half of 2020 to launch the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency will be backed by the Libra Reserve, a “collection of low-volatility assets like bank deposits and government securities, in currencies from stable and reputable central banks,” a Libra Association spokesperson tells Yahoo Finance. Libra Association says Libra is not a stablecoin, because it is not pegged to a single currency and does not have a fixed value in any fiat currency. Rather, a spokesperson says, it will be “a blend of multiple currencies,” so its value “will fluctuate in any given local currency, and exchanges will charge a spread above or below the value of the reserve.” Libra Association’s 28 “founding members” include: Facebook; Coinbase; Visa; MasterCard; PayPal; Stripe; Uber; Lyft; eBay; and Spotify. Every founding member has committed to a minimum investment of $10 million, and Libra Association says it aims to have 100 founding members by the time Libra launches. These companies will “work together on finalizing the association’s charter” but the Libra Association is not yet saying whether being a founding member means that all of these organizations will accept Libra as payment. The announcement stresses that the Libra Association is “independent.” But considering the co-orchestrated launch and simultaneous announcements, critics may scoff at the idea that Libra is truly separate from Facebook. There will also surely be widespread debate over whether Libra is truly a decentralized cryptocurrency, and whether its blockchain is truly permissionless. In a companion document to its announcement, Calibra stresses repeatedly that it will prioritize security. Calibra will be a regulated entity, and will keep customers’ financial data separate from Facebook social data. (Facebook has long had ambitions of offering financial services.) [MORE: Facebook hasn't told us: why launch a cryptocurrency?] The security guidelines continue, in boldface type: “Calibra will not share account information or financial data with Facebook, Inc or any third party without customer consent. For example, Calibra customers’ account information and financial data will not be used to improve ad targeting on the Facebook, Inc family of products.” The language is an obvious attempt to address and assuage the rising concerns around Facebook’s use of customer data, at a time when Facebook is under investigation by the FTC and the New York Attorney General. But the noise around Facebook’s privacy problems is now so loud, and has become such a major issue for lawmakers and 2020 presidential candidates, that a press release full of corporate security promises is unlikely to fully reassure any users who have been turned off by the entire scandal. Will a Facebook-endorsed cryptocurrency really be the thing to lure them back? The reports that Facebook would be getting into cryptocurrency have helped buoy the price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) in June, though the price was already on the rise recently. Bitcoin is up 30% in the past month and 140% in 2019 so far. But this has happened before: a big-name company appears to be dipping a toe into cryptocurrency; bitcoin believers cheer the news as a sign of mainstream acceptance; disappointment follows once the full details of the project come out. [MORE: Binance says Libra could spark ‘mass adoption’ of crypto] For example, when JPMorgan announced “JPM Coin” back in February it looked like a major bank was embracing cryptocurrency. But once details emerged, it became clear that JPM Coin is more of an internal token, only for use by JPM clients—not a true, decentralized cryptocurrency. (There was similar short-lived excitement about erroneous reports of Goldman Sachs launching a bitcoin trading desk.) Facebook’s dip into crypto looks different, because the goal appears to be for Libra to be used outside of Facebook’s walls, with those big-name, consumer-facing partners like Spotify, eBay, Uber, and Lyft. In other words, Facebook’s crypto project could be the one that truly does bring mainstream legitimacy and usage to cryptocurrency—but what will that mean for “the alpha and the omega” cryptocurrency, bitcoin? — Daniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

Browse the internet and you will see numerous sites and opportunities to win a free Bitcoin. However, it is unlikely that any of them are real. They are most likely scams trying to steal your money by offering you the chance of further riches. For those who perhaps missed out on the cheaper cost of Bitcoin and want to gain a holding without purchasing it directly, then trying to get free Bitcoin can be very tempting. Let’s have a look and see whether there are any legitimate chances to win a free Bitcoin on the world wide web. A legitimate chance to win a free Bitcoin took place on this very website as a promotion to celebrate its launch. The competition ran from October 2018 to January 2019, with the only entry requirement being to fill out a simple form. In the world of distrust that is cryptocurrencies, there was plenty of healthy scepticism around this competition. However, a winner was announced in January who was then invited to visit the Coin Rivet office to receive their prize. You can see the winner being announced here on our YouTube channel, along with their visit to our office, with CEO Sheba Karamat carrying out the handover duties. Were you to type “free Bitcoin” into Google, you will find a plethora of options. The legitimacy of most should be questioned, however. Many of the top results refer you to Bitcoin faucets. Faucets work as a reward system for users completing menial tasks such as filling in Captchas. While it is possible to earn free Bitcoin by completing these tasks, the payouts are such that you are only ever likely to receive a few satoshis in return for your time and effort. The profit from these websites is usually made through the variety of adverts they run. If you want to learn about Bitcoin and play around with very small amounts, then this might not be the worst introduction to the world of cryptocurrencies. A safer and more legitimate method of winning free Bitcoin is to provide a service to the community. The service can be anything you choose, be it helping with development, providing artwork, or merely being funny. Many members of Twitter or Reddit provide their Bitcoin wallet address for anyone who would like to tip them for the services they provide. Through this method, and if you are successful enough, you might find yourself earning some free Bitcoin or other form of cryptocurrency. If you are a risk-taker by nature, then gambling could be a potential method to win yourself some free Bitcoin. There are of course many risks to gambling – the casino always wins as they say. But there are now numerous cryptocurrency gambling websites that claim to offer fair chances of winning. If you strike it lucky, you may find yourself the proud owner of many more Bitcoin, but don’t ever bet more than you are willing to lose. Cloud mining is one method many people have used to earn themselves free Bitcoin. Through this, users provide capital upfront and are supposed to be rewarded with a cut of the mining profits of the pool. Most cloud mining platforms offer reward referral schemes as well. Yet for many of these sites, this is the actual income revenue that is then distributed, with little to no mining actually taking place. In essence, they become large pyramid schemes through these referral programs that continue to pay out to old users. Unfortunately, like many pyramid schemes, when there are no new users, they then collapse. It would be a wise move to steer clear of such websites. Famously, there used to be a number of Ethereum scam giveaway bots on Twitter that would latch onto famous Twitter personalities and offer free cryptocurrency. The only catch was that you had to send some first in order to receive more back. These scams became extremely popular and ultimately profitable for those running them. Should Bitcoin rocket in price, then expect to see a return of such schemes. If anyone or any website offers to give you free cryptocurrency in return for sending them some first, you may as well assume it is a scam. There are not many legitimate competitions to win a free Bitcoin, but it is possible there are some out there (as Coin Rivet showed). Always ensure you complete your own due diligence and verify the trustworthiness of anyone offering free Bitcoin. If you need to provide capital upfront to have a chance of winning, then it is likely to be a scam. As always, stay safe out there!

"Bitcoin suddenly plummets by $1,350"," Bitcoin took a massive tumble tonight as the celebrated high of $13,880 and a remarkable push towards $14k collapsed in a heap at $12,400. The sudden dump coincided with Coinbase going down following rumours that a $100m transaction into the San Francisco-based exchange was taking place. After starting the week with impressive momentum following Sunday’s successful punch through $10,000, BTC had been attracting a lot of attention as it began a strong ascent. Reaching out to the underside of $14,000, it had analysts across the globe tipping the original cryptocurrency to quickly lurch for almost unimaginable figures like $20k over the next few days. However, unconfirmed news that 8,884 Bitcoins were on the move to Coinbase coincided with what became one of the sharpest drops in the crypto’s ten-year history. Social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit were awash with all manner of unfounded rumours and conspiracy theories about Coinbase and its connection to BTC’s price. Earlier today, though, Coinbase did notify users via Twitter that some important scheduled maintenance work to its website would be taking place, backing up the suggestion that its going offline was purely coincidental at the time of Bitcoin’s dramatic plunge. At the time of going to press, BTC had arrested its freefall somewhat at around $12,500. Did deVere Group’s Nigel Green predict the recent BTC rise?

"Market Morning: Bitcoin ReBubble, Target India, Hong Kong Keeps Protesting"," Bitcoin Moves $1,400 Up, $1,400 Down, Speculators Get Woozy Is Bitcoin (BTC-USD) popping again? In both directions? Yup. The digital currency exploded over $1,000 per coin yesterday reaching a high of $13,775 before dropping over $1,400 in the space of about two hours, spurring murmurings of a second echo-bubble bursting in the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin trading as a percentage of total cryptocurrency trading volume has increased significantly since April in the meantime, climbing back up above the 60% mark for the first time ever since breaking below it during the introduction of Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD) and other popular coins. During the previous Bitcoin top in December 2017, BTC trading dominance reached 60% but didn’t cross it. We are now at 62.8%. The runner up is Ethereum (ETH-USD) at just below 10%, and Ripple (XRP-USD) at 5.66% total trading volume. The next resistance zone for Bitcoin is at around $17,560, though we are still far away from there. It could take hours. SEE: Boozer, Pineapple to Launch Remote Ordering of Recreational Cannabis Next Target In Trade Wars: India It’s the most populous nation in the world, and it’s making US President Donald Trump angry. India last year raised tariffs to 120% on a whole bunch of US items after the US withdrew preferential trade status from India as a third world nation that could really use some tax relief. “I look forward to speaking with Prime Minister Modi about the fact that India, for years having put very high tariffs against the United States, just recently increased the tariffs even further,” Trump tweeted, signaling more pain for both the US and India is in the works. The trade privileges that India enjoyed were under the Generalized System of Preferences that allowed duty-free exports of up to $5.6 billion. But since India kept its tariffs on the US up, which primarily hurts Indians rather than Americans, Trump thought this was unfair and now he’s raising a row. Indian stocks (BATS:INDA) could take a beating over this. Hong Kong Back To the Streets Hong Kongers are going back to the streets coinciding with the big G20 meeting this weekend, and they want Hong Kong on the agenda. Beijing isn’t too excited about this, and doesn’t want anyone to talk about it, because it makes them look bad, because it is bad. While the extradition bill that Beijing-sponsored Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has championed (probably because her bosses on Beijing would probably do something bad to her if she didn’t) was suspended, it was never withdrawn, which means that Lam is just waiting for the opportunity to reintroduce it and pass it through while the protesters are not looking. The bill would allow Beijing to extradite pretty much anyone it wants to on the basis that Xi Jinping feels like it. “We know that the G20 is coming. We want to grasp this opportunity to voice for ourselves,” said Jack Cool Tsang, a protester. How can anyone disagree with a guy named Jack Cool? It’s unthinkable. Meanwhile, Hong Kong stocks are in a holding pattern, near all time highs but waiting to see what happens next. (NYSEARCA:EWH) Target, eBay To Compete With Amazon Prime Day Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is just under 3 weeks away, set to hit the internet on July 15 when everyone is supposed to log on to Amazon at once, join prime, and shop like there is no recession around the corner. Target (NYSE:TGT) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are now stepping up to the plate in a bid to compete, daring Amazon.com to crash like it did last year on Prime Day so that it can offer even more sales. They are trying to one-up Amazon by not requiring any membership in order to enjoy the discounts. Amazon requires that people who want the deals sign up for a $119 a year Prime membership. Boeing 737 Has  A New Problem, May Not Return to Service Until July or Later Last month, officials at the Federal Aviation Administration had been saying that the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX series could return to service around late June, which is now, but now they have discovered a new flaw in the plane which they are not elaborating on, but cautioning that at this point, the soonest that the plane could do test flights for certification would be July 8th. Two people involved in the testing though gave a hint as to what is going on. During a simulator test last week running scenarios trying intentionally activate the safety system that pulled the nose down causing two crashes, it took too long to recover, Reuters was told. At this point it isn’t known whether whatever the problem was can be fixed with further software tweaks, or if the problem is in the hardware controlling the system, which would require new hardware be built, which would take a while. Boeing shares slipped late yesterday when news came out, but still finished the day positive.   The post Market Morning: Bitcoin ReBubble, Target India, Hong Kong Keeps Protesting appeared first on Market Exclusive.",ME Staff,Market Exclusive,2019-06-27T11:00:50.000Z
The Crypto Week – The Majors Hit Reverse 09/06/19," It’s been a bearish start to the month of June as the bears look to claw back control of the reins. Bitcoin fell by 0.95% on Saturday. Partially reversing a 2.36% gain from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $7,924.0. Bearish through most of the day, Bitcoin fell from an early morning intraday high $8,069.0 to a late afternoon intraday low $7,800.1. Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $8,178.63, Bitcoin came within range of the first major support level at $7,791.53 before finding late support. For the current week, Monday through Saturday, Bitcoin was down by 9.34% in spite of 3 consecutive days in the green mid-week. A bearish start to the week did the damage, with Bitcoin seeing heavy losses in the first 2-days of the week. In spite of the bearish week, Bitcoin managed to hold above the 23.6% FIB of $7,718 and touch $8,000 levels before reversing. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was a mixed bag for the pack. Bucking the trend from across the broader market, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash SV held onto gains through the current week. Monday through Saturday, Litecoin led the way with a 3.33% gain, with Bitcoin Cash SV up by 2.63%. Elsewhere, it was a sea of red. Leading the way down was EOS, which had tumbled by 17.6%. Bitcoin Cash ABC was a distant second, sliding by 11.5%. Ethereum (-9.3%), Stellar’s Lumen (-8.7%) and Ripple’s XRP (-8.1%) were also deep in the red for the week. The sell-off through the current week came as 24-hour trading volumes fell from $72bn levels at the start of the week to $57bn levels at the time of writing. The total crypto market cap slid from $275bn levels to $250bn levels at the time of writing. On the rankings, EOS’s heavy losses in the week led to a fall to the number 6 spot. Litecoin’s trend-bucking moves led to a move through to the number 4 spot, with Bitcoin Cash ABC at number 5. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.73% to $7,865.8. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning high $7,963.3 to a low $7,851.5. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested in the early part of the day. Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash SV, EOS and Litecoin saw the heaviest losses in the early hours. Bitcoin Cash SV led the way, down by 2.82% at the time of writing. EOS and Litecoin were down by 1.73% and 1.97% respectively. Bitcoin would need to move through to $7,930 to support a run at the first major resistance level at $8,061.30. The sentiment from across the broader market would need to materially improve, however, for Bitcoin to move back through to $7,900 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, Bitcoin would likely come up short of $8,000 levels. Failure to move through to $7,930 levels could see Bitcoin fall deeper into the red. A fall back through the morning low $7,851.5 would bring the first major support level at $7,793.4 into play. Barring an extended crypto sell-off through the day, Bitcoin would likely steer clear of sub-$7,700 levels.

Bitcoin looks to be poised on the verge of its next bull run, according to the head of one of the world’s most respected independent financial advisory organisations. Nigel Green, chief executive of deVere Group, claims that Bitcoin’s sustained foray above $8,000 today looks sustainable enough to build for a push even higher, propelling the value of the decade-old cryptocurrency to heights unseen since 2017. “Ditching its trademark volatility, Bitcoin has been stuck in no-man’s land for over a week, oscillating within a $600 range,” he said in a Coin Rivet article for the Daily Express. “But the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency surged to the upside on Wednesday and cleared the key $8,000 resistance level – this could indicate that Bitcoin is on the verge of the next bull run.” Analysts often refer back to past charts to see how periods of low volatility will often precede extended bulls runs – an historical fact Mr Green believes is about to repeat itself. “For instance, Bitcoin went through a relatively stable period in February this year, then the price ran towards $4,200 in March and to $9,090 before the end of May,” he explained. “Should Bitcoin experience a new run, we can expect it to deliver a boost to the wider crypto market, with other leading cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin rallying too.” Periods of market volatility are typically welcomed by traders and investors as they often present buying opportunities and deliver positive rewards. “However, I think moving forward, we are likely to see less extreme volatility,” added Mr Green. “Lower volatility is a sign of the maturation of the cryptocurrency market. “Although volatility will return again, as it does in all financial markets, I think we’re experiencing a fundamental shift and, overall, the crypto market will have less turbulent bouts in the future. “This is essential for the cryptocurrency sector long term as it will further encourage mass adoption and institutional investment. “Of course, no-one knows for sure when the next crypto run will happen, but current relative low volatility suggests it is imminent. “What we do know for sure, however, is that cryptocurrencies are the future of money.”   When is Bitcoin FOMO going to kick in?

4," The government of Singapore is planning to end goods and services tax (GST) (or value-added tax (VAT) as known in some countries) on cryptocurrencies that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange.  The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) published draft GST guidelines on Friday, stating that the supply of “digital payment tokens” in exchange for fiat currency or other digital payment tokens will be exempt from GST. Therefore, the supply of such tokens, being an exempt supply, “will not contribute to your annual taxable turnover for the determination of your liability for GST registration.” The proposal, if passes legislation, will become effective from January 1, 2020. The IRAS is currently seeking comments from cryptocurrency businesses, and they need to respond by July 26. The IRAS has defined digital payment tokens as having the following characteristics: “(a) it is expressed as a unit; (b) it is fungible; (c) it is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency; and (d) it is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, without any substantial restrictions on its uses as consideration.”  Bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), dash (DASH), monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and XRP are examples of digital payment tokens, the IRAS said. Notably, stablecoins do not qualify as digital payment tokens as per the definition by the authority. “A digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token but may instead fall under the list of financial services,” it said.",Yogita Khatri,The Block,2019-07-08T07:12:34.000Z

In the past few weeks, Kik admitted that the ICO landed the firm in hot water, causing extraordinary expenses to communicate with the US-based SEC. The chat app managed to raise between $70 and $100 million worth of Ethereum during its ICO, which took place at a time when ETH price was hovering around $300. But it is unclear what became of the funds and whether Kik sold some of the ETH. In any case, it is somewhat strange that one of the largest token projects would be seeking new funding. Currently, KIN is in the middle of a token migration, opening the opportunity for all Ethereum-based KIN owners to switch to the new network based on the Stellar (XLM) technology.

Crypto market cap sinks after huge BTC dump," Cryptocurrencies dropped another $20 billion in combined market value on Monday – less than 24 hours after posting a similar drop over the weekend. The sharp decline in market value was triggered after a single trader unloaded 20,000 Bitcoin on the Bitfinex exchange. In the span of roughly 16 hours, the total cryptocurrency market cap has fallen by over $30 billion, according to TradingView. The total value of the entire market is now $283 billion – the lowest since June. With the exception of Tether (USDT), which has seen its market cap swell in recent months, all of the top-20 coins by market cap were trading lower on Monday. Looking at the chart above, we can see the crypto market has now pulled back a whopping $78 billion from its yearly peak, when it touched $380 billion. Still, the long-term trend remains intact as it’s still above the 20-day EMA. In the past, we’ve seen similar price consolidations during bullish seasons, meaning there’s no reason to panic at all. Last week, I wrote about how the long-term trend of Bitcoin remains positive and that I’m expecting the price to hit $20,000 by the end of the year. What I’m doing personally is taking this opportunity to increase my main portfolio. Whether you want to bet on some prominent altcoins or just buy BTC’s dips, my point is it’s a good idea to take these opportunities to average your buy-ins to disperse your risk over time. Try to buy on a daily or weekly basis instead of waiting for a certain price range. It’s always a safer choice! looks like someone just claimed 20,000 $BTC in shorts on bitfinex… wow pic.twitter.com/QQXiZ1oaFb — Crypto Loomdart (@loomdart) June 30, 2019  In other news, it seems the most recent dip was caused by a huge short-seller who unloaded around 20,000 BTC on the Bitfinex market. Bitcoin’s sharp correction over the last 24 hours has had a cascading effect on the broader cryptocurrency market. At 60% market dominance, Bitcoin exerts a strong gravitational pull on altcoins and tokens. As a result, Bitcoin’s renewed volatility has knocked billions off altcoin values over the past five days. Of course, that followed a parabolic surge that drove the overall market to a high close to $390 billion. If a single sell order was responsible for Bitcoin’s sharp correction, then investors can expect a swift recovery in the short term. Bitcoin whales (oversized holders of the virtual currency) seem to have been responsible for at least two major price reversals in recent months. Each time, markets bought the dip and drove the price to new yearly highs. One of the more dramatic examples of a Bitcoin whale dump occurred in mid-May when prices plunged by more than $1,000 in the span of a few hours. The selloff was caused by a single trader who unloaded 5,000 units of BTC on Bitstamp, a leading digital currency exchange. It’s expected during bull markets for whales to take profits while Bitcoin rises to new yearly highs. I personally will take these opportunities to accumulate some more coins. Safe trades!

Bitcoin’s mining hash rate hits new all-time highs," Bitcoin’s mining hash rate has reached an all-time high of 65,000,000 TH/s following positive price action that has seen the asset’s total market cap rise above $200 billion. This level is now firmly above its mid-2018 highs of nearly 60,000,000 TH/s. Following Bitcoin’s parabolic move to the upside over the past few months, the total daily block and transaction reward paid to miners has also seen an almost five-fold increase, rising from under $5 million to currently above $25 million a day. This new all-time high means Bitcoin’s hash rate has completed a dramatic reversal after falling to almost half its current total during the December 2018 capitulation in BTC price. Based on estimates from Litecoin founder Charlie Lee’s September conference talk in San Francisco, the current SHA-256 hash rate translates into around $2 billion in online hardware value for the Bitcoin mining network. Other hourly costs for the network (based on a $0.1 per kwH electricity cost) come to around $605,000 in just electricity alone for those miners to hunt for 75 BTC which would currently trade at around $855,000. With the next Bitcoin halving just 330 days away, between now and then, we may see a new bull market break out for Bitcoin mining before the hourly reward drops down to 37.5 BTC. Mining difficulty is also up around 45% from the December low, while the price of Bitcoin has increased by over 260% in the same period. As ROI for mining operations continues to outpace the returns for BTC, the sideline investor may again look to make a move into the crypto ecosystem to get their hands on one of the 3.2 million BTC that are yet to be issued into circulation.

1," Asian Stocks Down, Europe Berates Iran on Nuclear Deal Chinese stocks (NYSEARCA:ASHR) are down this morning on news that President Trump didn’t actually promise Chinese President Xi Jinping a six-month hiatus on new tariffs, as widely reported in the media yesterday. So 25% tariffs on $300 billion Chinese goods coming into the US could come into effect at any time, possibly even right after the Trump/Xi talks end following the G20 meeting this weekend. Since signs are pointing to a global economic slowdown gathering momentum, this would be the first time since the 1930’s that significant tariffs would be instituted on the cusp of an economic recession. SEE: Canadian CBD Firm Alternate Health Acquires Blaine Labs On the Iranian front, Europe wants Iran to keep to its part of the nuclear deal, even though Iran isn’t getting anything it wants out of the nuclear deal, which is a lack of sanctions. Europe is forced to comply with these sanctions or risk being kicked off of the SWIFT international banking system, so there isn’t much that Iran is getting out of sticking to the old accords. Nevertheless, European officials urged Iran to do just that. “We will repeat to the Iranians that nuclear issues are not negotiable. We want them to stay in the accord, but we won’t accept them messing us around,” a senior European diplomat said. As to what will be done if Iran is “messing us around”, no word on that. Democrats Meet for Second Debate, Talk About Trump, Love Democratic party candidates gathered for a second debate last night, where they discussed, among other things, how to beat Donald Trump. One original idea came from Marianne Williamson, a candidate who has never before held any public office, but decided to channel Jackie DeShannon’s 1965 hit, “What the World Needs Now Is Love” maybe in an appeal to Baby Boomers. Williamson promised to “meet [Trump] on that field [of politics]” and “harness love for political purposes” emphasizing that “love will win”. Cheers erupted in the crowd on the prospect of victorious political love. Other highlights included front runner and former Vice President Joe Biden being excoriated for preventing California Senator Kamala Harris from being bused to school as a kid, and promising that if elected president, he would focus on, of all things, defeating Donald Trump. If Biden picks Williamson as his running mate, there might just be enough love to accomplish that, as long as Biden offers Harris a seat on the bus on the way to dropping her off at the Senate. New Age Beverages Gets Whipsawed In Short/Long Debate New Age Beverages (NASDAQ:NBEV) is in the spotlight in the cannabis sector this week, as conflicting reports have been released regarding the company. Grizzly Research reports that New Age may have been duped into buying a dying firm called Morinda, which it paid $75 million for in cash back in December, plus $10M in stock. Morinda is a multi-level marketing company in China, and Grizzly accuses it of inflating its financials with Morinda reporting higher figures that those it logged with Chinese regulators. However, New Age maintains that the report is inaccurate, but has yet to release a detailed rebuttal. New Age logged a loss of $1.6 million last quarter, posting record revenues of $58 million, and its stock remains on the low end of a trading range established last September. Shares remain in a long term uptrend since 2016. Putin Bashes Liberals While Russian Stocks Threaten to Break Out “[Liberals] cannot simply dictate anything to anyone just like they have been attempting to do over the recent decades,” Russian President Vladimir Putin was quoted as saying during a meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May. “The liberal idea has become obsolete. It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population.” Also, the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil with a nerve agent shouldn’t be considered a big deal. On the financial front in Russia, Russian stocks (NYSEARCA:ERUS) are threatening to break out to the upside, now at the highest levels since 2014, with the Ruble appearing to have been stabilized in a trading range ever since the oil collapse of that year that brought Russian stocks down in the first place. In signs that its economy is stabilizing, private sector credit loans are at record highs despite interest rates at 7.5%, and a bout of inflation appears to be under control, topping out at about 17% annual in 2015. Bitcoin Crash 3.0 Up Ahead As Volatility Explodes Bitcoin (BTC-USD) continues its epic earthquake, again, for the third time since 2013. Prices were as high as $13,756 on June 26 and fell to as low as $10,701 today, but are now back up to $11,863 at time of writing, but could be literally anywhere by the time you read this. Total market cap for all cryptocurrencies is down $50 billion since June 26 and remains 60% below all time highs set in December 2017, so we are nowhere near resuming a bull market, at least in price, if not in time. What the current volatility shows, once again, is that cryptocurrency values in dollar terms are not dependent on any sort of current events. MarketWatch columnist Mark Hulbert believes that there is an 80% chance that Bitcoin prices will crash. He bases this prediction on the rate of its recent rise, which has been parabolic. He doesn’t give a bottom call to his predictions, which are basically taken from a different paper, though the most recent Bitcoin bottom came in at around $3,200 depending on the exchange you’re using to gauge price.   The post Market Morning: No China Promises, Democrats Debate, New Age Crossfire, Russian Stocks Bullish appeared first on Market Exclusive.",ME Staff,Market Exclusive,2019-06-28T11:30:19.000Z
4," Facebook has today announced its new cryptocurrency and has revealed that its “ambition is for the Libra network to become permissionless”. The Libra network website claims that a key distinction in the blockchain space is the one between permissioned systems, “in which only a defined set of entities can shape consensus and governance”, and permissionless systems, “where anyone that follows the rules of the protocol and contributes the right types of resources” has a say. The team said that the distinction is important “not only from a technical perspective, but also from an economic one”. The Libra team described how permissionless systems have “low barriers to entry and innovation” and can be “resistant to censorship attacks”. This type of network architecture can “encourage healthy competition among infrastructure providers” as well as developers of applications on top of the network.  “Since nobody can exclude others from the market or censor their transactions, permissionless systems provide stronger guarantees to participants that no single party will be able to unilaterally change the rules of the network to their advantage at a future date. At their core, permissionless systems make irreversible commitments to operating as open networks where changes can only be implemented if they are democratically supported by a majority of constituents.”  “Since nobody can exclude others from the market or censor their transactions, permissionless systems provide stronger guarantees to participants that no single party will be able to unilaterally change the rules of the network to their advantage at a future date. At their core, permissionless systems make irreversible commitments to operating as open networks where changes can only be implemented if they are democratically supported by a majority of constituents.” The website reads: “To ensure that Libra is truly open, our ambition is for the Libra network to become permissionless.” However, the team also said: “The challenge is that as of today, we do not believe that there is a proven solution that can deliver the scale, stability, and security needed to support billions of people and transactions across the globe through a permissionless network. “With the testnet, the association starts the journey toward building a permissionless system. “We believe that for the Libra network to achieve its full potential, it needs to be permissionless. As a result, one of the association’s directives will be to work with the community to research and implement this transition, which will begin within five years of the public launch of the Libra Blockchain and ecosystem.” The project has revealed that in both its permissioned and permissionless states, the Libra Blockchain will be open, meaning any consumer, developer, or business can use the Libra network and build products on top of it. I'm going to run a Libra validator node. 😏https://t.co/jwJiAZSiFe pic.twitter.com/pjxvXXskQd — Julien Bouteloup (@bneiluj) June 18, 2019  In its glossary, Libra said that “on a permissionless network, anyone who meets certain technical requirements can access the network or operate a node”. This statement is obviously true for other major public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum that allow any participant to contribute towards either consensus or the ability to send transactions (uncensored) across its public blockchains. The network will kick off in 2020 using a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus approach among a group of validator nodes run by its Libra Association members. It has been revealed that the current ‘buy-in’ to run a node is around $10 million (of Libra investment tokens) and that this node network will have the ability to exert centralised control over the Libra Blockchain. Becoming permissionless will allow any participant to run a node (and take part in consensus) but also have a say in what may or may not be allowed to be processed on the Libra Blockchain from a technical perspective. If the project can fulfill its claim to be truly permissionless and open in five years’ time, then it may actually be a viable competitor to not just the mainstream banks, but also the truly open and decentralised cryptocurrencies that dominate the digital assets industry today.

Bitcoin mining hash rate approaches old highs," The Bitcoin mining hash rate is currently at 58,000,000 TH/s and is fast approaching its mid-2018 highs of nearly 60,000,000 TH/s. The hash rate has made a surprise comeback after falling to almost half its current total during the December 2018 capitulation in BTC price. The total daily block and transaction reward paid to miners has also seen an almost four-fold increase in the last six months, rising from under $5 million to currently above $20 million a day. Key to the recent rise in miner revenues has been the huge increase in transaction fees, which have gone from a daily total of $63,000 in late March to now more than $1 million a day over the last few weeks. Based on estimates from Litecoin founder Charlie Lee’s September San Francisco conference talk, the current SHA-256 hash rate translates into around $1.8 billion in online hardware value for the Bitcoin mining network. Other hourly costs for the network (based on a $0.1 kwH electricity cost) come to around $540,000 in just electricity for those miners to hunt for 75 BTC that would currently trade at around $660,000. With the next Bitcoin halving just under a year away, between now and then we may see a new bull market break out for Bitcoin mining before the hourly reward drops down to 37.5 BTC. Mining difficulty is also up around 30% from the December low, while the price of Bitcoin has increased close to 280% in the same period. As ROI for mining operations continues to outpace the returns for BTC, the sideline investor may again look to make a move into the crypto ecosystem to get their hands on one of the 3.2 million BTC that are yet to be issued into circulation.

12," Libra, the Facebook-supported cryptocurrency coming in 2020, has very ambitious plans and, already, vociferous critics. Facebook on Tuesday announced dual crypto ventures coming in 2020: Libra, a cryptocurrency that will be governed by the Libra Association, an “independent” consortium of 28 “founding members”; and Calibra, a Facebook subsidiary that will offer a digital wallet app for storing and sending Libra. While the “founding members” of Libra include some very big names in payments and commerce—like Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, Coinbase, and eBay—many still see the entire project as a Facebook venture, considering the simultaneously coordinated announcements and that Facebook executive David Marcus oversaw the Libra launch. But the Libra Association’s head of policy Dante Disparte, in an appearance with Yahoo Finance’s live show YFi AM, says that all of the founding members are buying in to an ambitious plan aimed at “universal adoption” of Libra. “I think there’s a clear, common connection among all the founding partners,” he says. “At one level, it’s a big moment for digital assets and cryptocurrencies generally, which is that they would be accepted with near universal adoption given those types of networks... also a commitment among the founding members to really drive a wedge on issues of financial inclusion and opportunity.” That sounds like a pretty grand plan for a digital coin that cryptocurrency devotees are already widely dismissing as not truly decentralized (since it’s overseen by a roundtable of companies that have each agreed to invest a minimum of $10 million) and running on a blockchain that is not truly “permissionless.”   Just so we are clear, Libra is:- not decentralized- not censorship resistant- not guaranteed to work technologically - not guaranteed to be cleared by regulators- not clear in regards to tax implications On the other hand, one of the biggest criticisms mainstream financial giants and Wall Street folks have had about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that they still don’t really function as cryptocurrencies—and indeed, even their biggest flag-wavers have shifted to hyping their use as stores of value, rather than actual daily currencies to spend. Libra, Disparte says, aims “first and foremost to put the term ‘currency’ back in cryptocurrency. It really is designed to be a unit of purchase and a unit of daily transactions, as opposed to a speculative asset—which is, candidly, where many cryptocurrencies have stood. And they’ve done well in that class if you’re interested in volatility. Libra, as an asset, is really meant to serve daily needs.”   It’s hard to launch a project that is criticized by both governments and decentralized crypto.Congrats on the launch, Libra! As for the questions around whether Libra can truly be seen as an independent cryptocurrency, Disparte counters: “I would say that from a structural point of view, this is a fairly enlightened moment on many levels. We have 28 founding members in this organization; it’s independent; the technology itself, while incubated initially at Facebook, is being set up as an open-source technology... The association itself is very much independently structured and governed.” There’s a key part there: the technology was incubated at Facebook – Facebook execs oversaw the rollout. But eventually, when the Libra blockchain launches, it aims to have 100 founding members, with no one member having more than 1% say in the governance. With that stated plan, Libra will aim to win over both the cryptocurrency skeptics and the cryptocurrency believers who are Libra skeptics. Lawmakers and politicians aren’t convinced: a handful came out immediately against the launch, using Libra as a punching bag to call for heightened regulation of Facebook. On Wednesday the Senate Banking Committee scheduled a July 16 hearing on Facebook’s cryptocurrency plans. — Daniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

100x leverage is coming to Bitfinex," Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino has teased on Twitter that the popular cryptocurrency exchange will soon offer up to 100x leverage. At the time of writing, the maximum leverage on Bitfinex is set at just 3.3x. By seasoned margin trading standards, 3.3x leverage is quite tame, with popular crypto derivative exchanges like BitMEX building their reputation on the ability to trade up to 100x leverage. At this level of leverage, only a 1% move against you would ‘liquidate’ your position – a level of volatility seen most days in the crypto markets. 👀🦁 pic.twitter.com/kBgPsGyOL3 — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) June 24, 2019  The maximum leverage used when opening a trade typically refers to the leeway you have to lose on a trade before it gets liquidated. For the 3.3x leverage that Bitfinex operates with today, if you used the maximum leverage and opened a margin short or long (without a stop loss), then the trade would typically confiscate all the margin reserved in the trade if the position moves against you by 30%. According to Ardoino, there will be no change to the current margin trading offering, and trading at the maximum leverage will be an “optional instrument” for Bitfinex traders. He said the offering will be isolated in order to mitigate the risks that are associated with ultra-high leverage trading. Traders are able to prevent additional losses by not applying any additional funds from their balance to their margin trading accounts on the Hong Kong-based exchange. The CTO also confirmed that only verified users would be able to use the new feature. Recent business development recruit Robert Jande Jong (or RJ) also shared a screenshot showing a set of tab options for trading, derivatives, and funding markets as part of the redesigned UI. finally a bitmex competitor. please DM me with an affiliate link i can use. i'm going to monetize my twitter account and retire, thanks — Udi Wertheimer [#irresponsible] (@udiWertheimer) June 24, 2019  Bitcoin coder Udi Wertheimer commented on the move, saying: “Finally, a BitMEX competitor.” In a nod to the success of the BitMEX referral program, he then asked Bitfinex to “DM me an affiliate link” as he is looking to “monetize my Twitter account and retire”.

2," Bitcoin Cash ABC rose by 1.52% on Monday. Reversing a 1.67% fall from Sunday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $477.25. A start of a day intraday low $460.78 saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall through the first major support level at $463.63 before finding support. Bitcoin Cash ABC rose to late morning high $476.5 before falling back to $465 levels and into the red. Support from the broader market kicked in late in the day, leading to an intraday high $477.25 at the day end. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 0.79% to $481.00. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall to a morning low $473.58 before finding support. Steering clear of the first major support level at $466.26, Bitcoin Cash ABC struck a morning high $482.46 before easing back. The first major resistance level at $482.74 pinned Bitcoin Cash ABC back early on. For the day ahead, a move back through the first major resistance level would support a run at the second major resistance level at $488.23. Bitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from $482 levels. Failure to move back through the first major resistance level could see Bitcoin Cash ABC pullback to sub-$480 levels. A fall through $471 levels would bring the first major support level at $466.27 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$460 levels. Litecoin fell by 1.02% on Monday. Following on from a 3.34% slide on Sunday, Litecoin ended the day at $135.26. A bearish start to the day saw Litecoin fall from an intraday high $136.66 to an early morning low $133.21. Litecoin fell through the first major support level at $133.84 before recovering to $136 levels. A second pullback in the late afternoon saw Litecoin slide back through the first major support level to an intraday low $132.13. Steering clear of the second major support level at $131.02, Litecoin managed to limit the losses on the day, with a move back through to $135 levels. At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 0.58% to $136.04. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin rise to a morning high $136.8 before easing back. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $137.24, Litecoin fell to a morning low $134.86 before finding support. Litecoin left the major support levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold onto $135 levels through the morning would support another run at the first major resistance level at $137.24. For the bulls, Litecoin would need a broad-based crypto rally, however, to bring $137 levels into play. Failure to hold onto $135 levels could see Litecoin see red for a 3rd consecutive day. A fall through $134.6 levels would bring the first major support level at $132.71 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Litecoin should steer clear of the second major support level at $130.15 and sub-$130 levels. Ripple’s XRP rose by 0.76% on Monday. Partially reversing a 1.5% fall from Sunday, Ripple’s XRP ended the day at $0.47402. A bearish start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP fall from a morning high $0.47046 to an early intraday low $0.44627. Ripple’s XRP slid through the first major support level at $0.4595 and second major support level at $0.4482 before finding support. Ripple’s XRP recovered to $0.46 levels and a relatively range-bound afternoon. A late rally saw Ripple’s XRP move through to $0.47 levels and strike an intraday high $0.47627 to avoid red on the day. At the time of writing, Ripple’s XRP was down by 0.39% to $0.47215. A choppy start to the day saw Ripple’s XRP rise to a morning high $0.47778 before hitting reverse. Coming up short of the first major resistance level at $0.4809, Ripple’s XRP fell to a morning low $0.46762 before finding support. Ripple’s XRP left the major support levels untested early on. For the day ahead, a hold onto $0.47 levels through the morning would support another run at the first major resistance level at $0.4809. Ripple’s XRP would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $0.47 levels. In the event of a crypto rally, the second major resistance level at $0.4878 could come into play before any pullback. Failure to hold onto $0.47 levels could see Ripple’s XRP test the first major support level at $0.4567 before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Ripple’s XRP would likely steer clear of sub-$0.44 support levels on the day.

Making this easy to understand isn’t easy," Having recently read an article on the BBC website purporting to try and explain the importance of blockchain to the world’s economy, I was struck by the intellectual muddiness of these waters and how easy it is to confuse blockchain with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with altcoins. It really is no wonder that the “man on the street” doesn’t understand these things, and consequently these misconceptions have become a real barrier to mainstream adoption. At the heart of blockchain, it really isn’t much more than a ledger or database (dependent on which descriptor you prefer). A blockchain database is unique, however, through its three pillars of being distributed (multiple copies of), being decentralised (no one copy has version control), and immutable (each transaction recorded is unchangeable). Bitcoin was the first blockchain, and as such is frequently referred to when trying to explain or understand blockchain. What the Bitcoin protocol (the underlying rules of the blockchain) solved technically was the double spend problem. This was key to creating a digital cash that was unforgeable. It’s easy to go too far down the rabbit hole on Bitcoin and start looking at the economic programming and proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism that makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors, but this takes us away from understanding blockchain. In order to offer a simple explanation of the difference between blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, it’s best to use the analogy of the internet and email. Email, it’s widely agreed, was the internet’s first killer app – so email is simply an application built on top of the internet, but the internet offers far more than just email. Similarly, Bitcoin was blockchain’s first killer app, and as such, all cryptocurrency is built on top of a blockchain – but blockchain can do so much more than just cryptocurrency. With blockchain working as a shared ledger and acting as a trusted central source of truth, we can see organisations looking to solve such complex topics as digital identity (Sovrin), supply chain digital transformation (Tradelens), food provenance (IBM Food Trust), and efficiency in the transportation and logistic industry (BITA). Under the cloak of darkness, many companies are aiming to create proof of concepts that can deliver real-world results for their various industries. In time, the cloak will be lifted and we will see which ones have succeeded and, hopefully, which ones have failed and we can learn from. The Bitcoin protocol is slow, but this is not the protocol that would be used in enterprise environments. The Bitcoin protocol is energy hungry (through PoW), but enterprise blockchains would not use PoW as its consensus mechanism. If you’re looking at having a digital form of money, it makes sense that there should be a cost to creating it in the form of energy consumption. If you’re aiming to clean up the luxury goods markets from fakes and rip-offs, a consortia of luxury goods manufacturers and retailers using proof of authority makes sense – it really is a case of horses for courses. The article also discusses the value that many intermediaries have, and this isn’t wrong. There are plenty of middlemen that actually add value to our every day lives, including the basic function of banking to be the trusted custodian of our money. However, there are also plenty of things that commercial banks do that do not add value, and we should take back sovereignty over – international transfers of money for one. Centralised third-party middlemen are not the problem, the degree to which we can trust them to act on our behalf is. The BBC article misunderstands a basic precept about Bitcoin regarding the speed of transactions by comparing it to Mastercard and Visa. A better comparison for Bitcoin is gold, where transaction in the metal takes a long time and costs a lot of money as it’s generally done as a settlement layer at central bank level. One day in the future, I, and many others believe that Bitcoin will be able to be used as simply as Mastercard or Visa is today, but that requires a layer two solution (such as Lightning), and a much more significant market cap that would be in the trillions of dollars. We may be some way from that being a reality at the present time, but that is just a reason why we should make the effort to understand these issues today. The article jumps to talking about problems with other blockchain based currencies, known as altcoins, but without creating a clear distinction from Bitcoin and creating the clarification that there is no “the blockchain”, but actually many different flavours of the same concept. Many of the altcoins, are based upon a token that drives actions on top of the matching blockchain. For example, Ethereum was a new protocol that went live in 2015 and was intended to be a decentralised global computer with the ability to execute smart contracts. Ether was the token created both as a way to raise the initial funds to build the technology and is now the gas that powers it. Ethereum also paved the way for a glut of new tokens created by entrepreneurs (and scammers) on top of the Ethereum protocol, most of which only had a utility within the application built on top of it. Many people have tried to create new cryptocurrencies, some through forks of pre-existing protocols and coins (such as Bitcoin), and some as entirely new protocols. For some of the entrepreneurs that went down this road, it was little more than a way of making themselves rich. However the main problem with the altcoins when trying to be viewed as money, is that they tend to be overly centralised (meaning that the transactions and rules of the currency won’t have as much trust), and look to reduce energy consumption and speed up transaction throughput through different consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-stake (PoS) or delegated PoS, and tend to lack scarcity – if you understand economics, it’s fairly easy to see that without significant cost and scarcity, there can be no significant value created with respect to money. Again, look at the comparison to finding and excavating gold from the earth. My belief is that in ten years’ time, Bitcoin will have either changed the world we live in or will have become virtually valueless. Conversely, I believe that blockchain is here to stay and will change the world but needs to fade into the background. The reality is that blockchain is still mostly hype, as was the internet in 1994. The industry needs time to develop – just because it’s hype today, it doesn’t mean that there isn’t real world-changing tech there.

Trump Wakes the Gold and Bitcoin Bugs," A recent breakout in the price of gold has gold bugs excited. Source: Jeremy Vohwinkle via Flickr (Modified) The price has shot up $40 per ounce in the last week, from less than $1,280 to almost $1,320 per ounce. “Global tensions bolster safe-haven demand,” is the kind of headline that is going to get aficionados of gold stocks very excited. But this is a debate the other “money is just a construct, man” fans, the bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD) bugs, very much want to have. That’s because the price of bitcoin, relative to gold, has shot up in 2019. You could buy a bitcoin with just 3 ounces of gold at the start of the year. It now costs 6.5 ounces. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Thus, gold bug Peter Schiff was walking into a trap when he agreed to debate bitcoin advocate Barry Silbert at a recent SALT conference in Las Vegas. Bitcoin fans had a field day. But did either side have a point? The serious question was, what’s money? The serious answer is that money is whatever you say it is. Money is used to exchange real value, to arbitrate between, say, stories written by this writer and the good people at InvestorPlace. It’s more a verb than a noun. What you want out of money is stability. If you’re shipping a tanker of oil across the seas so you can refine and burn it, you want the value of that oil to be the same on both ends of the voyage. In those terms, neither gold nor bitcoin is money. The price of gold peaked in 2011 at $18,000 and crashed in 2013 to its present trading range. It remains volatile. Bitcoin, meanwhile, zoomed to $20,000 in 2017, crashed to $3,200 late in 2018 and recently traded at $8,500. Gold and bitcoin, in other words, are both speculative assets, not money, because they don’t offer the stability of money. The question then becomes which is more useful and when? Schiff argued that because central banks buy gold and don’t buy Bitcoin that gold is money. Money was once backed by gold and was defined as gold. When everything else crashes it could happen again. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad agrees. He wants Asian countries to create a pan-Asian currency backed by gold because, he says, gold’s value is more stable. Silbert, CEO of Greyscale Investment, argued that bitcoin is better because it’s useful. Thousands of jobs are being created in blockchain start-ups. Bitcoin’s price has proven its resiliency. As money becomes electronic, bitcoin’s value can only grow, he argued. What Schiff and Silbert agreed on is that “fiat currency,” the kind endorsed by central banks, is the riskier bet. Fear sells gold and fear is also propelling bitcoin. Fears of a trade war, of governments using their currencies as a weapon in that war, is propelling both assets. If bitcoin were to hit $50,000, as some crypto-bulls predict, it would prove bitcoin isn’t money, because money’s value lies in its stability. Bitcoin advocates have yet to answer for things like flash crashes, thieves, the shut-down of exchanges, and all the other scams that remain prevalent in their crypto world. Bitcoin bulls insist their asset is an alternative to government control. That means there’s no cop you can turn to when you’re robbed. In the end, the asset you choose to hoard is the one that’s right for you. You can buy rights to gold and move with those rights, but you need to trust the vault owner. You can buy bitcoin and learn to trust the exchange. Everything carries risk. Dana Blankenhorn is a financial and technology journalist.

," Bitcoin and XRP are not competitors, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a Fortune interview this week. The former is a store of value or “digital gold,” while XRP is a “bridge currency” that enables an efficient solution for fiat-to-fiat transfers, he argued. “I own Bitcoin, I’m long Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is a store of value and people hold it.” Garlinghouse went on to state that there will not be one single cryptocurrency to “rule them all”. And he also noted that there is “a lot of bullshit in the blockchain and crypto market.” By way of example, he flagged up a recent CNBC article entitled ‘Facebook Launches Cryptocurrency’. Facebook has done nothing of the sort, Garlinghouse pointed out. Rather the social media giant has announced plans to do so in a year from now. Ripple should be losing sleep over Facebook’s Libra currency as it will do away with the need for hundreds of altcoins, including XRP, according to crypto analyst Max Keiser. In a tweet dated 7th June, he said: “The altcoin apocalypse is nigh. This will drive Bitcoin higher as BTC competes with gold, not fiat”. Crypto payments ventures could also be wiped out, he added. The $FB global stable coin… FaceCoin obviates need for hundreds of alt-cons including XRP. The alt-coin apocalypse is nigh. This will drive Bitcoin higher, as BTC competes with Gold, not fiat.

DASH Technical Analysis – Support Levels in Play –24/06/19," How to Buy DASH DASH fell by 1.03% on Sunday. Partially reversing a 4.84% rally from Sunday, DASH ended the week up 10.3% to $173.211. A bearish start to the day saw DASH fall to a late morning intraday low $169.391 before finding support. Whilst steering clear of the first major support level at $157.938, fell through the 23.6% FIB of $172 before finding support. DASH recovered through the afternoon to a late intraday high $179.015. In spite of the late recovery, DASH fell well short of the first major resistance level at $188.315 before falling back to a 2nd half of a day low $170.895. The late pullback saw DASH fall back through the 23.6% FIB of $172 before recovering to $173 levels. Following a 51% gain in May that led to a current year high $198.89, it’s been a mixed month in June. A bearish start to the month saw DASH slide to a June low $135.1 before finding recovering. For the current month, DASH was up 4.34% to the end of Sunday, with last week’s rally pulling DASH into the green. The extended bearish trend formed back at late April 2018’s swing hi $547.97, remained firmly intact in spite of the recovery. DASH continues to fall well short of the 38.2% FIB of $244. At the time of writing, DASH was down by 1.26% to $171.024. A bearish start to the day saw DASH fall from an early intraday high $172.613 to a low $169.286. Whilst steering clear of the major support and resistance levels, DASH fell back through the 23.6% FIB of $172. A move back through the 23.6% FIB of $172 to $173.90 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $178.35. DASH would need support from the broader market, however, to break out from $174 levels on the day. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, DASH would likely fall well short of $178 levels on the day. Failure to move back through the 23.6% FIB of $172 could see DASH slide back to sub-$170 levels. Barring an extended sell-off through the day, however, DASH will likely steer clear of the first major support level at $168.73.

And it gets better…’FOMO’ could take Bitcoin from $9,000 to $20,000 within months, Fundstrat Global Advisors Co-founder Tom Lee told CNBC this week. “I think it is easily going to take out its all time highs,” he declared. Not everyone is getting out the party balloons and champagne, however. “I’m still not sold on the idea that it’s up, up, up from here,” says Simon Peters, Analyst at eToro. “We’re due a significant correction still and prices could fall back to as low as $6,500 before the next major rise. That said, you can’t ignore the continuing price surge we’ve seen this year.” As for the latest rise, global politics could be one reason, Peters reckons. “It’s busy out there with the US-China trade war rumbling on, a new Prime Minister on the way in Britain and protests in Hong Kong. Some investors will naturally be spooked and are seeking a safe haven in assets like crypto. Bitcoin’s price may have also been boosted by Tether ‘printing’ another $150 million, which has historically been associated with a bump in crypto prices,” he concludes. George McDonaugh, CEO and Co-Founder of KR1, also advises caution, “On the long way up to $20,000 there were five moments where there was a 40% decrease in price. These shake-outs test your staying power and many new entrants will hand their precious coins back to the market,” he says. “We will see huge corrections again, and passing 10k may well be the catalyst that drives us back down, but whatever happens, we’ve been clearly shown that the interest, adoption and money has not in any way left this new asset class.” The post First $10k, then $11k as Bitcoin enjoys super Saturday appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Scott Thompson,Coin Rivet,2019-06-22T13:00:55.000Z

In August 2008, the domain name bitcoin.org was registered. On 31st October 2008, a paper was published called “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was authored by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin. To date, no one knows who this person, or people, are. The paper outlined a method of using a P2P network for electronic transactions without “relying on trust”. On 3rd January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence. Nakamoto mined block number “0” (or the “genesis block”) which had a reward of 50 Bitcoins. Ripple is a real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) developed by the Ripple company. It is also referred to as the Ripple Transaction Protocol (RTXP) or Ripple protocol. It can trace its roots to 2004 when a web developer called Ryan Fugger had the idea to create a monetary system that was decentralised and could effectively allow individuals to create their own money. Ethereum was launched by Vitalik Buterin on 30th July 2015. He was a researcher and programmer working on Bitcoin Magazine and he initially wrote a white paper in 2013 describing Ethereum. Buterin had proposed that Bitcoin needed a scripting language. He decided to develop a new platform with a more general scripting language when he couldn’t get buy-in to his proposal. Bitcoin Cash was born out of the idea of making Bitcoin more practical for small, day-to-day payments. In May 2017, Bitcoin payments took about four days unless a fee was paid, which was proportionately too large for small transactions. A change to the code was implemented and Bitcoin Cash was born on 1st August 2017. Litecoin was released in October 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee. It was a fork of Bitcoin with the main difference being a smaller block generation time, increased maximum number of coins, and a different script-based algorithm.

32," The crypto bulls are out in force this week. Bitcoin rose by 5.1% to $10,744.0 on Saturday. Following on from a 6.86% rally on Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,744. A particularly bullish morning saw Bitcoin rally from an intraday low $10,080 to an early afternoon intraday high and new swing hi $11,232. The rally saw Bitcoin break through the major resistance levels to touch $11,000 levels for the first time March 2018. For the current week, Bitcoin was up by 19.6%, which came off the back of 5 days in the green out of the last 6. Across the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was bullish for all but one of the majors. Bucking the trend on the day was Binance Coin, which fell by 2.36%. In spite of the Saturday pullback, Binance Coin was up by 17.8%, Monday through Saturday. Across the rest of the majors, Bitcoin Cash ABC led the way, rallying by 9.9% to hit $500 levels for the first time since the November hard fork. Bitcoin Cash SV (+7.49%), Ripple’s XRP (+7.15%), and EOS (+6.22%) also saw solid gains on the day. While Binance Coin saw red on the day, Litecoin continued to trail the majors, rising by just 1.6%. For the current week, Bitcoin led the way with its 19.6% rally, Monday through Saturday. Binance Coin came in a close second, with its 17.8% gain. Ethereum (+15%), Bitcoin Cash ABC (+12.5%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+11.2%), and Ripple’s XRP (+11.6%) also saw double-digit gains. Stellar’s Lumen bucked the trend, falling by 1.03%, with Litecoin rising by just 3.26%. The weeklong rally saw the total crypto market cap jump from a start of a week $285.84bn to an end of Saturday $329.55bn. Sidelined investors returned to the market, with the 24-hour trading volume rising from $74.17bn to a Saturday high $98.25bn. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.14% to $10,729.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to a morning high $10,985.0 before falling to a low $10,687.0. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance level untested in a relatively range-bound start to the day. Elsewhere, Stellar’s Lumen was up by 3.19% to move into positive territory for the week. Bitcoin Cash SV and Bitcoin Cash ABC also found early support, rising by 2.00% and 1.25% respectively. Litecoin and EOS joined Bitcoin in the red early on, down by 0.26% and 0.04% respectively. Bitcoin would need to steer clear of sub-$10,700 levels through the morning to support further upside on the day. A move back through the morning high $10,985.0 to $11,000 levels would bring $11,200 levels into play. Bitcoin would need support from the broader market, however, to take a run at the first major resistance level at $11,290.67. A fall through $10,685 would bring the first major support level at $10,138.67 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, Bitcoin will likely steer clear of sub-$10,000 levels on the day.

," In a recent interview on London Real, the Bitcoin and open blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos talked about the wrong type of people entering the digital asset economy, and why many end up staying for different reasons other than price. On the topic of the many hype-based cryptocurrency projects we see today, Antonopoulos said that the industry sometimes attracts the wrong type of crowd into the ecosystem. “It attracts scammers, opportunists, pump and dumpers, and pyramid schemes, and the ICO market enabled a lot of those people to make their own coins.” Andreas said that one of the reasons the ICO craze happened was because Ethereum made it easy for people to build a scalable, secure, transferable, and censorship-resistant blockchain “just by writing 20 lines of code”. But the Mastering Ethereum author said that in the first 2017 wave of mania, people used these newly-created programmable blockchains “to build platforms to do massive pump and dumps” instead of building projects focused on privacy and censorship resistance. However, he did mention that in the long run, “if you can fund start-ups with an international pool of investors, that can change the investment fields”. FOMO is in the air. Newbies are joining the cryptocurrency space and falling prey to scammers.  Please educate your friends and family:– Promises of profit are 100% ponzi– Request to ""recruit"", ""affiliate"" etc are 100% pyramid schemes– ICO/IEO are 99.99% pump-and-dump — Andreas M. Antonopoulos (@aantonop) June 20, 2019  Regarding the parabolic rises and falls of many crypto assets, Andreas said that “nothing goes exponential without going down”, and that Bitcoin has done this eight times already as “that’s how it grows”. “The reason it grows like this is that there isn’t much in terms of short pressure to hold it down,” he said. “If you’ve got something that has limited supply and you suddenly have a speculative mania that blows up, it will continue to go up in a straight line, which only further fuels the mania. “Until it reaches a point where there simply isn’t anybody else who feels just as enthusiastic and it pauses for a second, the panic just drives [the price] down.” Andreas said that there’s “no difference between speculators and investors” and that they’re just speculating with a different risk profile, with some of them doing so “with very little research and information”. He said that the reason this is bad is that “a lot of good, innocent, and slightly naive people lost a lot of money” and had their lives destroyed because of this. This has a negative effect “as it changes the community” and “causes damage to the community”. “You have a lot of drama that comes up when there’s money on the table – people’s personalities change.” He said that people start taking shortcuts and their ethics become compromised – “power corrupts, money corrupts”. Andreas said that the majority of people first got involved in crypto most likely “because they heard that it’s some kind of investment opportunity”. He made the case that even though many of these people may have first entered the space “because of speculation and mania”, the people who were only motivated by price left during the 2018 crash, with those who stayed “finding other motivations”. He claimed some of the reasons why people stay is because they like the community, they understand the technology, and they may even be “driven by the political implications”. To those people, Andreas said: “Welcome, you may have come because you want to get rich – that’s okay. Now let me tell you about why you should stay because of the technology even after the price crashes.”   The post Andreas Antonopoulos wants people to stick with crypto appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Nawaz Sulemanji,Coin Rivet,2019-07-03T13:00:11.000Z
339," Facebook (FB) on Tuesday announced the details of its widely-rumored cryptocurrency project: a financial services offering called Calibra. Calibra is a “newly formed Facebook subsidiary” and its first product, launching in 2020, will be a digital wallet to store and send Libra, a new cryptocurrency. The digital wallet will initially be available inside WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, and eventually as a standalone app for iOS and Android. Calibra will enable users to send Libra to each other “as easily and instantly as you might send a text message, and at low to no cost.” Eventually, Facebook says, “we hope to offer additional services for people and businesses, such as paying bills with the push of a button, buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code, or riding your local public transit without needing to carry cash or a metro pass.” Libra, the cryptocurrency, will run on its own Libra blockchain, which today launches an open-source testnet. The blockchain and cryptocurrency will all be overseen by the Libra Association, a not-for-profit that is separate from Facebook and headquartered in Geneva. The Libra Association posted its announcement at the same time as Facebook’s Calibra announcement, and says it is targeting the first half of 2020 to launch the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency will be backed by the Libra Reserve, a “collection of low-volatility assets like bank deposits and government securities, in currencies from stable and reputable central banks,” a Libra Association spokesperson tells Yahoo Finance. Libra Association says Libra is not a stablecoin, because it is not pegged to a single currency and does not have a fixed value in any fiat currency. Rather, a spokesperson says, it will be “a blend of multiple currencies,” so its value “will fluctuate in any given local currency, and exchanges will charge a spread above or below the value of the reserve.” Libra Association’s 28 “founding members” include: Facebook; Coinbase; Visa; MasterCard; PayPal; Stripe; Uber; Lyft; eBay; and Spotify. Every founding member has committed to a minimum investment of $10 million, and Libra Association says it aims to have 100 founding members by the time Libra launches. These companies will “work together on finalizing the association’s charter” but the Libra Association is not yet saying whether being a founding member means that all of these organizations will accept Libra as payment. The announcement stresses that the Libra Association is “independent.” But considering the co-orchestrated launch and simultaneous announcements, critics may scoff at the idea that Libra is truly separate from Facebook. There will also surely be widespread debate over whether Libra is truly a decentralized cryptocurrency, and whether its blockchain is truly permissionless. In a companion document to its announcement, Calibra stresses repeatedly that it will prioritize security. Calibra will be a regulated entity, and will keep customers’ financial data separate from Facebook social data. (Facebook has long had ambitions of offering financial services.) [MORE: Facebook hasn't told us: why launch a cryptocurrency?] The security guidelines continue, in boldface type: “Calibra will not share account information or financial data with Facebook, Inc or any third party without customer consent. For example, Calibra customers’ account information and financial data will not be used to improve ad targeting on the Facebook, Inc family of products.” The language is an obvious attempt to address and assuage the rising concerns around Facebook’s use of customer data, at a time when Facebook is under investigation by the FTC and the New York Attorney General. But the noise around Facebook’s privacy problems is now so loud, and has become such a major issue for lawmakers and 2020 presidential candidates, that a press release full of corporate security promises is unlikely to fully reassure any users who have been turned off by the entire scandal. Will a Facebook-endorsed cryptocurrency really be the thing to lure them back? The reports that Facebook would be getting into cryptocurrency have helped buoy the price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) in June, though the price was already on the rise recently. Bitcoin is up 30% in the past month and 140% in 2019 so far. But this has happened before: a big-name company appears to be dipping a toe into cryptocurrency; bitcoin believers cheer the news as a sign of mainstream acceptance; disappointment follows once the full details of the project come out. [MORE: Binance says Libra could spark ‘mass adoption’ of crypto] For example, when JPMorgan announced “JPM Coin” back in February it looked like a major bank was embracing cryptocurrency. But once details emerged, it became clear that JPM Coin is more of an internal token, only for use by JPM clients—not a true, decentralized cryptocurrency. (There was similar short-lived excitement about erroneous reports of Goldman Sachs launching a bitcoin trading desk.) Facebook’s dip into crypto looks different, because the goal appears to be for Libra to be used outside of Facebook’s walls, with those big-name, consumer-facing partners like Spotify, eBay, Uber, and Lyft. In other words, Facebook’s crypto project could be the one that truly does bring mainstream legitimacy and usage to cryptocurrency—but what will that mean for “the alpha and the omega” cryptocurrency, bitcoin? — Daniel Roberts covers bitcoin and blockchain at Yahoo Finance.

18," The value of bitcoin is up 102% in 2019. But the most important story playing out in the cryptocurrency world right now is an enforcement action by the SEC against Canadian chat app Kik Interactive. If you follow cryptocurrency at all—either as a speculative investor or as a believer in the technology—you should pay close attention to what happens next. On Monday, the SEC sued Kik for its “unregistered” ICO (initial coin offering) back in 2017, which the agency says was an illegal securities offering. In the token sale, Kik created and sold 1 trillion Kin tokens and raised $100 million; the SEC says $55 million of that came from U.S.-based investors. It was one of the five biggest ICOs of 2017. Kik, which has about 200 employees, knew the SEC action might be coming: In November 2018, the SEC issued Kik a Wells Notice, which informs companies that the agency is considering enforcement action. In a Medium blog post in January, Kik CEO Ted Livingston responded to the notice, promising that “We’re fighting back.” In that blog post, Livingston correctly wrote, “This is the thing that everyone in the industry is dealing with, but nobody wants to talk about... This situation is not unique to Kik. There are dozens of projects at a similar point with the SEC.” As Yahoo Finance reported last year in a joint investigation with Decrypt, the SEC had been reaching out to dozens of companies that conducted ICOs to request documentation or threaten enforcement—and in many cases quietly got settlements. But in November 2018 the SEC’s crusade against unregistered token sales got a lot less quiet when it publicly announced a handful of settlements. That month it also slapped boxer Floyd Mayweather with more than $600,000 in fines and rapper DJ Khaled with $152,000 in fines for promoting ICOs on their social media accounts. This new lawsuit against Kik is the most noteworthy enforcement action to date, and the result will be important for the entire industry. It might set the new standard of how companies conduct an ICO, if any still dare to try it. (Blockstack is already looking to pull off the first big ICO conducted with full SEC registration and approval.) The core issue the SEC has with ICOs is simple: it believes almost every token sale is a security offering. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton made that stance clear at a Senate hearing in February 2018 when he said, “I believe every ICO I’ve seen is a security.”   Capital raising through blockchain requires compliance with federal securities laws https://t.co/IjOxjoVdfK The SEC bases its view on SEC v. Howey, a 1946 case involving the selling of shares in a citrus grove. The SEC applies the Howey Test to determine whether an offering is raising money from investors in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit from the efforts of others. In its official Wells Response in November 2018, Kik retorted that buyers of Kin coins “were not led to expect profits from the efforts of others.” Kik CEO Livingston also makes the case that Kin is truly used as a currency and not a security, since Kik users can earn and spend Kin inside the Kik app and in other apps as well. Now it’s worth revisiting what Livingston said in interviews back in 2017 about the Kin ICO. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, he said, “Kin is a new way for us to monetize and compete... If supply [of Kin] stays constant and demand for it grows, the value of the cryptocurrency will grow. So that if we set some of it aside for ourselves, we can make a lot of money... If we can create Kin, integrate it into Kik, that will make it really valuable.” Does that sound like a company promising returns from a securities offering? The SEC believes it does. In the 49-page complaint, the SEC writes: “Kik marketed the Kin tokens as an investment opportunity. Kik allegedly told investors that rising demand would drive up the value of Kin.” The SEC also accuses Kik of resorting to an ICO as a “hail Mary pass” because the company was “faced with a shrinking financial runway” and “decided to pivot.” And indeed, in the same 2017 interview with Yahoo Finance, Livingston made the point that Kik and other tech startups needed to innovate and try new things in order to avoid getting “copied and crushed” by giants like Facebook. But the SEC’s lawsuit against Kik is no guaranteed win. Kik, which says it has 15 million monthly users, clearly does not intend to settle, even though it has already spent $5 million in legal fees dealing with the SEC.

DASH Technical Analysis – Support Levels in Play –02/07/19," How to Buy DASH DASH fell by 0.51% on Monday. Following on from an 8.37% slide on Sunday, DASH ended the day at $154.47. A bullish start to the day saw DASH rise to an early morning intraday high $160.9 before hitting reverse. Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $166.92, DASH slid to a mid-afternoon intraday low $145.95. The reversal saw DASH fall through the first major support level at $149.00. Finding support late in the day, DASH broke back through the first major support level to $154 levels to limit the downside on the day. Following a 51% gain in May DASH fell by 6.2% in June, with a bearish end to the month seeing DASH slide from a June high $187.65 to $150 levels. The reversal came after a recovery from a bearish start to the month that had seen DASH slide to a June low $135.1. The extended bearish trend formed back at late April 2018’s swing hi $547.97, remained firmly intact following the late June pullback. DASH continued to fall short of the 23.6% FIB of $172 after having failed to take a run at the 38.2% FIB of $244. At the time of writing, DASH was down by 2.29% to $150.94. A bearish start to the day saw DASH fall from a morning high $154.05 to a low $150.84 before steadying. DASH left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. A move back through to $154 levels would signal a possible rally later in the day. DASH would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from $154 levels. In the event of a broad-based market recovery, a move through to $158 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $161.6 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Monday’s high $160.9 should limit any upside. Failure to move through to $154 levels could see DASH slide deeper into the red. A fall through the morning low $150.84 would bring the first major support level at $146.65 into play. Barring a crypto meltdown, DASH should steer clear of sub-$140 support levels on the day. Major Support Level: $146.65 Major Resistance Level: $161.60 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $172 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $244 62% FIB Retracement Level: $360 Please let us know what you think in the comments below Thanks, Bob This article was originally posted on FX Empire",Bob Mason,FX Empire,2019-07-02T02:22:16.000Z
Andreas Antonopoulos believes banks are about to ‘lose a whole generation of customers’," Andreas Antonopoulos doesn’t have much hope for the decentralisation claims of the upcoming Facebook cryptocurrency, but he does think that it may be the first in a new wave of Silicon Valley coins set to directly compete against an established set of incumbent banking giants. Speaking to a packed house at the recent London Coinscrum meetup, the open source advocate hypothesised that Facebook may be planning “an open network where anyone can join”, but soon the company is going to run into a couple of legal constraints. Antonopoulos mocked the true intentions of the social media platform, saying: “If they can build a truly decentralised and permissionless coin, then I will join the board of directors.” Can't wait for a cryptocurrency with the ethics of Uber, the censorship resistance of Paypal, and the centralization of Visa, all tied together under the proven privacy of Facebook. https://t.co/C4FymDjtFw — Sarah Jamie Lewis (@SarahJamieLewis) June 14, 2019  He exclaimed that “Facebook can’t do that” as “they’re not an open source project”. He then went on to pull apart Facebook’s current business model, saying: “They’re not today operating across different countries. They have legal jurisdiction in specific countries, and in those specific countries, there are laws about what you can and can’t do with money.” According to Andreas, these are “laws that Bitcoin doesn’t have to deal with” because it’s an open source and decentralised project. Queues for @aantonop's book signing @coinscrum pic.twitter.com/BokX8b9mQn — Coinscrum (@coinscrum) June 13, 2019  He said: “First they are going to have a committee inside Facebook, and they’re going to say let’s build a completely open, decentralised cryptocurrency, and the lawyers at Facebook (who outnumber everybody) are going to go whoa, we can’t allow that. “They can’t be borderless because they have to abide by the regulations that prohibit transfers of money across borders without know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.” Antonopoulos believes that Facebook will have to vet every participant in the transaction and the social media giant “can’t be neutral because they can’t just transfer value from anyone to anyone for any purpose”. Due to these factors, he summarised: “Facebook cannot build an open, decentralised cryptocurrency because they’re prevented by law – no company can do what Bitcoin does. “So who they are really competing with and who should be terrified by this are banks. Banks are currently now squeezed between a rock and a hard place – or a Bitcoin and a Facecoin. “On the one hand, they’ve got an open and decentralised zoo of cryptocurrencies that they can’t plan, they can’t compete, they can’t co-opt, they can’t sue, they can’t buy, and they can’t even get the government to shut it down (even though they have been trying). “The thing that they pride themselves on the most is being progressive technology companies. If you think Facecoin is coming, so is Apple coin, Amazon coin, Twitter coin, Uber coin, and AirBnB coin, and every other Silicon Valley corporation.” Antonopoulos believes that every company is going to get into this space eventually, especially if Facebook shows it to be profitable and successful. With many banks now offering the same fundamental financial services to consumers, they are not going to stand a chance against a whole bunch of Silicon Valley tech giants who already know how to do “user experience and user interface better”. The open blockchain advocate thinks that the best part of this “is that they [the banks] have to compete with these [Silicon Valley] giants that will actually have perfected the art of using artificial intelligence to tickle your dopamine receptors”, and now “they’re going to deliver banking to you”. He thinks this may lead to a “horrific surveillance capitalism” where all of your payment information will be sold “to everyone, everywhere”, leading to the destruction of privacy and democracy in all developed countries. With a tongue-in-cheek taunt to the fiat banking industry, Antonopoulos concluded: “For the banks, it’s even worse. Their profit margins are going to go down by at least 8% – and that’s serious.” The post Andreas Antonopoulos believes banks are about to ‘lose a whole generation of customers’ appeared first on Coin Rivet.",Nawaz Sulemanji,Coin Rivet,2019-06-17T12:00:04.000Z

"Poloniex could leave itself open to legal threats by socializing 1,800 BTC loss"," Legal questions hang over Poloniex, the cryptocurrency exchange, after a price crash in a little known alt coin forced the firm to liquidate the positions of traders on the platform. What happened On May 26, altcoin $CLAM collapsed more than two thirds of its value during the day, resulting in the margin lending pool incurring a more than $13 million USD loss in today's price of bitcoin. Now, Poloniex is tapping into 1,800 BTC from the principal of active BTC margin loans to cover the loss to the lending pool. In margin trading, exchanges and traders can lend crypto at an interest rate for borrowers to trade, hopefully at a gain. Users have to pay back what they are lent. When a borrower is unable to pay back the loan, they default, losing money they didn’t have to begin with. Some trading CLAM, a coin with low liquidity, began to default on their loans as the value of the coin dropped, making them unable to pay since their assets were now worth far less than when they borrowed. Worse, many of those who defaulted had used CLAM for collateral on the loans, the amount put up to safeguard against an extreme loss for the lender, like a deposit. Since the coin had reached such a low value, that collateral became nearly worthless as well. While Poloniex said it is uncommon for traders to use CLAM as collateral, non U.S. traders can do so with any asset available for lending. The number of defaults left the lending pool with 1,800 BTC unrepaid by borrowers. To mitigate the loss, Poloniex “socialized” it among BTC margin traders. The exchange took 16.202% from the principal of all currently active BTC loans even those that weren’t active at the time of the crash. While only affecting 0.4% of Poloniex users, this still incurred the ire of some BTC margin traders. But more than that, it raised questions about how losses can be sustained by crypto exchanges. Can they do that? Poloniex said it spread the loss among BTC lenders because the exchange pools loan on margin to mitigate risk.  ""Because all BTC loans on Poloniex are lent in a common pool that is shared across all markets and borrowers, but we want to emphasize that we are pursuing defaulted borrowers to get them to repay the BTC they owe to lenders and exploring other ways to defray losses,"" said a company spokesperson. ""As we recover funds, we will return them to affected lenders."" The legality of the practice was questioned by sources, including Silver, but it's unclear what that means for the crypto economy since there hasn’t been a public case interpreting the problem. That could change if Poloniex’s U.S. based BTC lenders decide to take legal action, and legal sources say they probably will. “Any crypto exchange that socializes losses is begging for a lawsuit,” said David Silver, an attorney specializing in securities law. A former crypto exchange executive said it depends on how one defines ""legal,"" since lending is state-regulated unless you have a federal license. To be clear, the firm said it only offers margin lending and borrowing to non-US customers. The firm said it is “exploring other ways to help defray margin lender losses, and, as we recover funds, will return them to affected lenders."" The Block did not find a clear term in Poloniex’s terms of service indicating a precedent for socializing a loss, and Poloniex did not directly respond to the question in an email interview, but said the 16% figure was proportional to the amount of losses in the lending pool. Regardless, Silver said it would be unlikely for a court to allow an exchange to socialize a loss even with a term of service stated. “I highly doubt any court would allow that to stand,” he said. Stephen Palley, another attorney with Anderson Kill, disagreed with Silver, saying he didn't necessarily think Poloniex breached their terms of service.  ""Now maybe you could blame them for listing an asset with a thin order-book like clam,"" he said. Still, one anonymous source in capital markets consulting, told The Block Poloniex should have had more controls in place to monitor the liquidity of the asset, giving warning calls to traders if necessary. ""If there was a liquidity squeeze on this type of asset they should have had better risk management controls,"" said the source. Other steps taken In response to the crash, Poloniex did more than give its BTC lending pool a haircut. All defaulted accounts have been frozen until the loans are repaid. ""Margin lending and borrowing are only available to non-US customers, we are pursuing the defaulted borrowers to get them to repay the BTC they owe to lenders,"" said a company spokesperson. It removed BTS, CLAM, FCT and MAID citing a lack of liquidity in these markets. A liquidity problem led to the CLAM crash, since traders couldn’t liquidate their positions fast enough to get out from under the falling value. Poloniex said it would continue to monitor the coins and could reinstate them in the future. The exchange has also added additional layers to monitor markets so it can disable problematic assets. It also plans to add more market protections to prevent price slippage and over-concentration, including the NICE/Actimize tool which was implemented on June 1. Update: This post has been edited to attribute claims of the legality of Poloniex’s actions to Silver and other sources. We also added commentary from Stephen Palley, an attorney with Anderson Kill. ",Aislinn Keely,The Block,2019-06-07T17:38:59.000Z
California’s Cannabis Delivery Service Now Accepts Bitcoin," SpeedWeed, California’s only legal cannabis delivery platform, announced that it is now accepting Bitcoin (BTC-USD). Customers can now use the popular cryptocurrency to purchase legal marijuana products from licensed dispensaries and have them delivered directly to their door, the company said in a statement. “With banks and credit card companies shying away from the cannabis industry, customers are forced to pay in cash. That’s really inconvenient. We have a better way,” SpeedWeed Director of Operations Ken Breese stated. “By allowing members to pay with crypto, we’re able to keep our promise: SpeedWeed is the safest, most convenient way to have cannabis delivered.” Launched in 2011 as a family business, SpeedWeed has become the largest cannabis delivery platform in America with over 200,000 members and growing. It gained notoriety for delivering medical marijuana to the homes of some of Hollywood’s biggest stars.

In the past few weeks, Kik admitted that the ICO landed the firm in hot water, causing extraordinary expenses to communicate with the US-based SEC. The chat app managed to raise between $70 and $100 million worth of Ethereum during its ICO, which took place at a time when ETH price was hovering around $300. But it is unclear what became of the funds and whether Kik sold some of the ETH. In any case, it is somewhat strange that one of the largest token projects would be seeking new funding. Currently, KIN is in the middle of a token migration, opening the opportunity for all Ethereum-based KIN owners to switch to the new network based on the Stellar (XLM) technology.

," Cryptocurrency asset manager Bitwise and Swiss fintech company Amun AG have launched a new exchange-traded product (ETP) on Switzerland’s top stock exchange SIX, and it promises to offer diversified liquid exposure to the nascent digital market.   Bitwise has licensed “The Bitwise 10 Select Large Cap Crypto Index” to Amun AG, which will be used as the benchmark index for the new ETP product - “Amun Bitwise Select 10 Large Cap Crypto Index ETP” with the ticker symbol KEYS.   Notably, the ETP will not be available to U.S. customers, according to the statement from Bitwise.  Bitwise said that the index will track the performance of up to 10 of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world, as measured and weighted by free-float and inflation-adjusted market capitalization. Currently, the index comprises of eight cryptocurrencies - bitcoin (weight: 67.80%), ether (11.50%), XRP (8.33%), bitcoin cash (3.52%), litecoin (3.47%), EOS (3.36%) Stellar lumens (1.10%) and Cardano (0.90%), per the statements.  The index will provide non-U.S. investors “diversified exposure” to the crypto markets, said Matt Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise Asset Management. The index will be rebalanced and reconstituted every month. Hougan said it is designed for Swiss investors who want to “gain and maintain exposure to the most important crypto projects in the world.”  Bitwise built the ETP using Amun's Onyx issuance and administration platform, Hany Rashwan, CEO of Amun, told The Block, adding that “we have 2-3 additional customers that will use the platform by Fall to list their own products. After that point, we will open this platform up much more broadly.” Amun AG already manages four crypto ETPs, which are also listed on the SIX exchange - Crypto Basket Index ETP (HODL), Bitcoin ETP (ABTC), Ethereum ETP ((AETH) and the recently launched Amun XRP ETP (AXRP).  All the four ETPs are “heavily traded,” Amun AG said in the statement, adding that the HODL ETP is the “most traded USD-denominated ETP on SIX since inception on Nov. 21, 2018, in terms of trading volume.” “Of all the existing crypto products currently listed globally, the Amun Bitwise Select 10 ETP is uniquely the most diversified listed crypto product,” said Rashwan.",Yogita Khatri,The Block,2019-06-26T14:49:20.000Z
2," After rising to prominence in the cryptocurrency scene in 2017 and 2018, Brenna Sparks is now one of the most influential people in the industry. With a wide audience spanning different markets, the adult movie star is striving to promote self-sovereignty through the decentralisation that cryptocurrencies can encourage. Coin Rivet recently had the chance to chat with Brenna about her role with SpankChain, her controversial pick as an influencer, and her views on cryptocurrencies in general. You’re an advisor for SpankChain, what are its goals? The goal is to create a dedicated ecosystem for the adult industry, free from censorship and free from discrimination. Can you explain why you believe SpankChain is an important project? For those not in the know, can you explain the issues currently within the adult industry and how projects like SpankChain can help? Right now, there is a lot of discrimination against adult workers, and it’s only getting worse with the policies that are being pushed at the government level. The banks do not care about you. The government doesn’t care about you. You’re essentially on your own. Whenever such tyrannical behaviour makes an appearance, the only way to defeat it is with technology, and that technology to defeat it is what SpankChain is focused on building. We’re not interested in sitting around waiting for people to make up their minds, nor are we interested in wasting our time picketing. The ones that understand this are out there, building a new path that goes around the current mess, and it isn’t only limited to the adult industry. Have you noticed other industry workers getting involved or has the uptake been slow? The industry is very quick to recognise the importance of cryptocurrencies. It’s not difficult for them to see the solution, unlike the average citizen. What was the first cryptocurrency you bought? You were a fan of the Silk Road if rumours are to be believed. Bitcoin was the very first cryptocurrency. And I was a fan of the Silk Road. It was very useful for people who didn’t have a dedicated weed dealer. Has getting involved in cryptocurrencies changed your outlook politically or economically? Very much. I’ve become a lot more libertarian. As far as economics goes, I follow the Chicago school of thought. What does your involvement in cryptocurrencies look like? Do you trade and code or buy and hold? I trade here and there. I don’t waste my efforts on technical analysis and prefer to focus on fundamentals. I hate owning a lot of coins and prefer to put my money towards coins I really believe in. Of course, I will gamble a bit here and there for fun. You’ve recently started coding, did this interest arise from cryptocurrencies? Is this something you’re looking to get into after your porn career is over? I think getting into crypto has got me close with many developers and has definitely sparked some real interest. It’s too soon to tell if I will do it long term, but so far I’m really enjoying it and learning about concepts I have never ever thought about before, as well as concepts that used to confuse me. The feeling of getting smarter seems to be enough motivation. I’ve always liked the idea of being a nerd, so it’s likely I will be a giant nerd of something one day… maybe coding, or maybe something else. A nerd nonetheless. What other industries do you anticipate cryptocurrencies will disrupt other than the adult industry? I know this sounds a bit crude, but everything. We are talking about currency here, and there isn’t much stuff in this world that money doesn’t intersect in one way or another. Even the very nature of governance is changing with the advent of cryptocurrencies. Real estate, retirement, insurance, health care, company funding, employment, banking, diplomacy, war, you name it – it’s all being re-evaluated. Nothing will remain the same. We’re truly experiencing something that has never existed in the world before, something that effects every human on the planet. You’ve mentioned before that you fancy being a venture capitalist one day. Will cryptocurrencies help achieve these goals? And if so, what kind of industries would you like to invest in? It was something that I played with, but if crypto gets to where I believe it will, I actually think VCs will become obsolete. Why on Earth would anyone want to give up portions of their company in exchange for money when they can fund it without giving up any percentage? One very special thing that nobody seems to talk about is just how much collective support companies get in this space. I believe the future of companies will be very cult-like, where they have large followings that will assist in funding and any other additional support. The role of VCs will be a lot less noticeable than it is today. This is just my guess. As for the industries I’m interested in, I’m most interested in the gaming industry. I think that space will have a huge positive impact and is still full of opportunity. A couple of projects that I’m watching closely right now are Enjin, Decentraland, and Theta. I also have some interest in VR, AI, and fog computing. Has there been a particular highlight that has stood out since entering the world of cryptocurrencies? The amount of money you can make (and lose) in this space never seems to have an end. A person has never experienced an emotional roller coaster until they’ve sat in this industry for at least two years. CoinDesk nominated you as one of the most influential people in the industry for 2018. What was your reaction to that? How did you deal with the criticism that came your way from the nomination? I was surprised and humbled. I really don’t think I deserve it, but hey! I don’t get to decide this. I’m very blessed for it, and it has brought me nothing but opportunities since. The criticisms were expected. It went a bit overboard when people began mobbing me and actually changed some deep philosophical views I had on free speech. After experiencing mobbing, my belief in free speech was damaged pretty badly, and there is very little holding it up today. Now, I find it difficult to justify. It’s not okay to group up and hurt people in the name of free speech. That was a very big change on me for sure, and it didn’t come from reading a book or anything, but simply from experiencing the hurtful actions of strangers. What does the rest of 2019 and 2020 hold for Brenna Sparks? Networking! These next two years are all about networking for me. I want to develop great friendships and partnerships. I’ve gotten my recognition, and now I want to push it to the next level and start working with others.

20-year-old crypto millionaire: Facebook Calibra is going to be ‘huge’ for crypto," Facebook (FB) finally announced its long-awaited cryptocurrency offering Calibra this week, and one Bitcoin (BTC) millionaire thinks it will be huge. The social network on Tuesday officially unveiled Calibra, a cryptocurrency system launching in 2020 that includes a stablecoin called Libra, as well as a digital wallet inside Messenger and WhatsApp that will let users store, send and receive Libra. Pegged to a basket of government-issued currencies to avoid pricing volatility, Libra will launch with at least 29 partners, including Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Uber (UBER), and Spotify (SPOT), and be governed by an independent council. According to 20-year-old Bitcoin millionaire Erik Finman, Calibra is an “amazing” product that will help legitimize cryptocurrency and bring mainstream attention to the overall space. “This is going to be huge for the cryptocurrency space — it’s a huge deal,” says Finman, founder of the bitcoin investing platform CoinBits. “If cryptocurrency wasn’t obvious before, it’s really obvious now. It’s here to stay, and it’s here forever. This isn’t just a project anymore or something that’s in the gallows of the internet.” Finman carved out a reputation among crypto enthusiasts for investing in Bitcoin (BTC) back in 2011 at $12 a coin using $1,000 his grandmother gave him. The 20-year-old’s investment ballooned to $4 million during Bitcoin’s all-time high in 2017, earning him the nickname “the teenaged bitcoin millionaire.” Incidentally, Finman also won a bet with his parents: if he became a crypto millionaire before he turned 18, he could skip college. But as exciting as Calibra sounds, it also raises some “scary” possibilities, Finman adds. “There’s a part of me, again, that says that [Calibra] is great for the credibility of cryptocurrency,” Finman emphasizes. “And while that’s probably the best thing from Mark Zuckerberg’s point of view, it could also be the worst thing depending on how Calibra evolves. Look at all the crazy stuff Facebook’s been doing with your privacy and security.” Besides using Facebook user data towards its sophisticated advertising products, the social network has also come under fire over the last 18 months for incidents regarding user privacy. The Cambridge Analytica scandal from March 2018, for instance, resulted in voting firm Cambridge Analytica gaining access to the information of up to 87 million Facebook users without their consent. Indeed, Facebook anticipates paying a $3 billion to $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission for its privacy lapses. In its white paper published this week, Facebook added that Calibra will be independently governed by the Libra Association Council, based in Geneva. And while the group will serve as the entity through which the Libra Reserve — a reserve of ""financial assets"" for backing Libra — is managed, Finman indicates this more “centralized” model could be used for Facebook’s benefit. After all, Libra will be stored in digital wallets hosted by Facebook-owned services such as Messenger and WhatsApp. “That's very much against the mood in which cryptocurrency was invented, which was, you know, freedom, decentralization, no one to shut it down, and no centralized control,” Finman contends. “The Libra Association and Facebook basically control the development of Calibra. It’s scary, inherently, because it’s run by a massive giant entity, and it’s scary, especially with the reputation Facebook has.” Only time will tell whether Finman’s fears are founded.

," Bitcoin rose by 1.85% on Sunday. Following on from a 2.56% gain on Saturday, Bitcoin ended the week up 6.34% to $11,485. On the day, a relatively range-bound morning saw Bitcoin fall to an intraday low $11,110 before finding support. The pullback saw Bitcoin fall through the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 before recovering to $11,300 levels. A second pullback in the afternoon, saw Bitcoin fall back through the 23.6% FIB before striking an intraday high $11,620. On the day, while Bitcoin fell short of the major resistance levels, Bitcoin’s move back through the 23.6% FIB was key. The bullish end to the week contributed to yet another weekly gain and there have been numerous since the start of the year. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin has seen just 8 weeks in the red, which has given Bitcoin a 200% gain year-to-date. All of this in spite of a pullback from 26th June’s current year high $13,764. Bitcoin’s dominance held onto 62% levels. Bitcoin’s market cap has also found support, recovering from sub-$200bn levels on Sunday to $211.17bn at the time of writing. For the Bitcoin bulls, the near-term bullish trend, formed at mid-December’s swing lo $3,215.2 remained intact. Bitcoin has continued to find support at the 23.6% FIB of $11,275. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 3.49% to $11,886.0. Range-bound through the early morning, Bitcoin fell from a start of a day $11,547 to a morning low $11,310 before making a move. Steering clear of the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 and the first major support level at $11,190, Bitcoin rallied to a late morning high $12,040. Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $11,700 and second major resistance level at $11,915 to hit $12,000 levels before easing back. A hold above the first major resistance level at $11,700 would support another break through the second major resistance level at $11,915. Bitcoin would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from the morning high $12,040. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin would likely come up short of the third major resistance level at $12,425. In the event of a crypto rally, expect Bitcoin to take a run at $13,000 levels. This morning’s divergence has set the bulls up for a big afternoon if the rest the majors can recover. Failure to hold above the first major resistance level at $11,700 would see Bitcoin cough up the morning gain. A pullback through to sub-$11,400 levels would bring the 23.6% FIB of $11,275 into play before any recovery. Barring a crypto meltdown, we would expect Bitcoin to steer clear of the first major support level at $11,190. In the event of a meltdown, sub-$11,000 support levels could come into play before any recovery. We would expect the second major support level at $10,895 to limit any downside in the event of a sell-off.
